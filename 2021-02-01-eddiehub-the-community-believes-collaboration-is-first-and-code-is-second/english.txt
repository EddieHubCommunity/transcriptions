Hi there, I am Eddie

Our community is called EddieHub

We believe that collaboration comes first and code comes second

We are an inclusive open source community that focuses on supporting each other

No matter where you are in your journey

Remember even if you only have 1 month experience

There is someone where you were 1 month ago

Helping others is a great way to learn and grow your network

We have my YouTube where you will find lots of tutorials about open source and GitHub

I also do live streams getting you involved in open source and finding you the green squares

Also, I bring awesome guests on there to hang out with us

We also have a GitHub organisation that you can join

Just raise an issue on the support repo with the type "invite me to the organisation"

And the GitHub Action will do all the magic and do all the rest, and send you an invitation

Remember if you would like other people to see you are part of our organisation

You have to make it public on your profile, only you can do that

We have many projects in our GitHub organisation from Discord bots written in typescript to react frontends

And everything in between

If you want to get involved our community will help you

You can also get your open source project review by the community and by me

And you guessed it by raising an issue on our support repo with the issue type "review my open source project"
If you want to chat between YouTube videos and live streams and your open source green squares

We also have a Discord where you can come and join the conversation

With many exciting things going on and so much more to come

If you want to learn more about open source, collaborate and improve your technical and your communication skills

Join our community to accelerate your career

Looking forward to chatting with you soon
