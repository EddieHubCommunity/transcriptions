Helping others is a great way to learn and
grow your network

0:00:26.360,0:00:30.220
We have my YouTube where you will find lots
of tutorials about open source and GitHub

0:00:30.220,0:00:35.820
I also do live streams getting you involved
in open source and finding you the green squares

0:00:35.820,0:00:39.070
Also I bring awesome guests on there
to hang out with us

0:00:39.070,0:00:42.480
We also have a GitHub organisation that you
can join

0:00:42.480,0:00:46.510
Just raise an issue on the support repo with
the type "invite me to the organisation"

0:00:46.510,0:00:51.630
And the GitHub Action will do all the magic
and do all the rest, and send you an invitation

0:00:51.630,0:00:54.510
Remember if you would like other people to
see you are part of our organisation

0:00:54.510,0:00:57.800
You have to make it public on your profile,
only you can do that

0:00:57.800,0:01:03.030
We have many projects in our GitHub organisation
from Discord bots written in typescript to

0:01:03.030,0:01:04.579
react frontends

0:01:04.579,0:01:06.189
And everything in between

0:01:06.189,0:01:09.299
If you want to get involved our community
will help you

0:01:09.299,0:01:13.429
You can also get your open source project
review by the community and by me

0:01:13.429,0:01:18.899
And you guessed it by raising an issue on
our support repo with the issue type "review

0:01:18.899,0:01:22.409
my open source project"
