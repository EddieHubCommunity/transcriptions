gina with us and gina has got

0:00:59.680,0:01:03.520
an amazing open source project that she

0:01:02.079,0:01:04.479
works on full time and so you know

0:01:03.520,0:01:06.640

0:01:17.600,0:01:21.439
well thank you eddie first of all thanks

0:01:19.520,0:01:24.159
for uh letting me be here

0:01:21.439,0:01:25.759
uh yeah my name is gina hoisker that's a

0:01:24.159,0:01:26.080
bit of a tricky name for a lot of people

0:01:25.759,0:01:30.000
who

0:01:26.080,0:01:33.200
did not grow up in germany and

0:01:30.000,0:01:35.759
i am the creator and maintainer of

0:01:33.200,0:01:36.799
a little nifty project called octoprint

0:01:35.759,0:01:39.200
which is like

0:01:36.799,0:01:40.400
remote monitoring slash baby monitor

0:01:39.200,0:01:42.799
solution for

0:01:40.400,0:01:44.399
uh 3d printers which people can just

0:01:42.799,0:01:46.000
install on the little raspberry pi or

0:01:44.399,0:01:48.320
something like that and attach to the 3d

0:01:46.000,0:01:51.040
printer and then have it

0:01:48.320,0:01:53.200
enhanced by with a with a web interface

0:01:51.040,0:01:54.000
which they can monitor everything about

0:01:53.200,0:01:56.560
which they can send

0:01:54.000,0:01:57.119
jobs to install plug-ins and all that

0:01:56.560,0:02:00.479
stuff

0:01:57.119,0:02:02.880
and yeah that's me that sounds

0:02:00.479,0:02:04.799
awesome i want to know more about that

0:02:02.880,0:02:06.640
but i suppose before we get to that

0:02:04.799,0:02:09.200
so how did you get into tech like when

0:02:06.640,0:02:12.879
did you start was it uni was it before

0:02:09.200,0:02:16.400
after uh way way before actually so

0:02:12.879,0:02:17.440
um i i was always a bit of a weird child

0:02:16.400,0:02:19.760
i think

0:02:17.440,0:02:22.319
because at h3 i already wanted like a

0:02:19.760,0:02:25.040
huge heavy drill hammer and all that but

0:02:22.319,0:02:26.160
um around when i was six or seven or so

0:02:25.040,0:02:28.959
my parents got

0:02:26.160,0:02:30.480
uh um the first computer of the

0:02:28.959,0:02:31.920
household which back then was an apple

0:02:30.480,0:02:35.760
two e

0:02:31.920,0:02:36.720
and uh i wanted to play with that but my

0:02:35.760,0:02:38.239
dad told me

0:02:36.720,0:02:40.560
yeah well you know that that is more

0:02:38.239,0:02:43.120
like a tool not another plate

0:02:40.560,0:02:43.760
no no not a toy and uh but i can tell

0:02:43.120,0:02:45.280
you i

0:02:43.760,0:02:47.599
can show you something awesome and so he

0:02:45.280,0:02:50.879
introduced me to basic

0:02:47.599,0:02:52.480
uh i could not speak a word of english

0:02:50.879,0:02:54.160
back then and everything in basic is

0:02:52.480,0:02:57.440
english so that was a bit weird but

0:02:54.160,0:02:59.120
um yeah but he he he showed me some

0:02:57.440,0:03:02.400
basic commands and

0:02:59.120,0:03:04.400
yeah instead of the the more like um

0:03:02.400,0:03:06.480
traditional hello world in my case it

0:03:04.400,0:03:08.560
was uh the name of a

0:03:06.480,0:03:10.480
very popular children's tv show in

0:03:08.560,0:03:12.480
germany that was

0:03:10.480,0:03:14.159
running in an endless loop on the screen

0:03:12.480,0:03:16.400
after a couple of minutes and that was

0:03:14.159,0:03:17.680
how yeah basically that was la the first

0:03:16.400,0:03:21.680
sight um

0:03:17.680,0:03:25.840
and ever since then i have been coding

0:03:21.680,0:03:29.040
um and yeah i've always been

0:03:25.840,0:03:31.200
interested in tech stuff and and

0:03:29.040,0:03:31.760
figuring out how stuff works how things

0:03:31.200,0:03:33.360
work i

0:03:31.760,0:03:36.159
always disassembled everything that i

0:03:33.360,0:03:39.120
got my hands on as a child and

0:03:36.159,0:03:39.840
so that was i think a natural segue so

0:03:39.120,0:03:43.599
to speak

0:03:39.840,0:03:45.680
um and what i also absolutely loved

0:03:43.599,0:03:47.599
and still actually do love and and to

0:03:45.680,0:03:50.720
this they do is build lego

0:03:47.599,0:03:52.560
and uh computer programming is a bit

0:03:50.720,0:03:54.480
like building with lego but without you

0:03:52.560,0:03:55.760
ever running out of bricks in my opinion

0:03:54.480,0:03:59.760
so that was

0:03:55.760,0:04:02.400
also like a natural um fit for me

0:03:59.760,0:04:03.920
so that this is how i got started i like

0:04:02.400,0:04:06.640
the way you explained that

0:04:03.920,0:04:08.319
coding is like lego but it's like it's

0:04:06.640,0:04:11.519
digital you never run out of bricks

0:04:08.319,0:04:12.879
love that i'm so gonna and you can even

0:04:11.519,0:04:14.799
yeah and you can even build your own

0:04:12.879,0:04:16.000
bricks i mean if you we need one that

0:04:14.799,0:04:17.600
has a specific shape

0:04:16.000,0:04:19.199
right you can just you don't have to

0:04:17.600,0:04:20.400
wait for lego to produce it you just do

0:04:19.199,0:04:22.320
it yourself

0:04:20.400,0:04:23.600
love that that is right it's building

0:04:22.320,0:04:24.479
blocks i really like that we used like

0:04:23.600,0:04:26.240
you know

0:04:24.479,0:04:27.759
other libraries packages to help us do

0:04:26.240,0:04:30.880
it we can write our own as well

0:04:27.759,0:04:32.720
which i think is is awesome so let's

0:04:30.880,0:04:34.560
hear more about

0:04:32.720,0:04:35.919
um i love your open source project i

0:04:34.560,0:04:38.400
think it's awesome like it's in

0:04:35.919,0:04:39.440
you know in the 3d you know printing

0:04:38.400,0:04:42.639
space which is just

0:04:39.440,0:04:45.680
so exciting so awesome and how did you

0:04:42.639,0:04:47.440
come about with this idea was it one of

0:04:45.680,0:04:48.960
those situations where it was

0:04:47.440,0:04:50.080
you know scratch your own itch did you

0:04:48.960,0:04:51.199
have like do you see something missing

0:04:50.080,0:04:52.320
and you built something for yourself and

0:04:51.199,0:04:55.680
then it just kind of

0:04:52.320,0:04:58.160
grew from there exactly that so i got

0:04:55.680,0:05:01.280
myself my first 3d printer back in

0:04:58.160,0:05:05.039
i think november 2012 uh

0:05:01.280,0:05:06.720
2012. yeah 2012. uh and

0:05:05.039,0:05:08.160
it was sitting right here next to me in

0:05:06.720,0:05:11.360
my office

0:05:08.160,0:05:13.199
and uh well back then printers do not

0:05:11.360,0:05:14.080
necessarily have their own memory or

0:05:13.199,0:05:15.840
anything on it

0:05:14.080,0:05:18.000
uh like they do these days where you can

0:05:15.840,0:05:18.880
at least plug an sd card in and print

0:05:18.000,0:05:20.880
from that but

0:05:18.880,0:05:22.560
you still had to have a tethered to your

0:05:20.880,0:05:24.720
to your computer

0:05:22.560,0:05:26.000
and stream all the the commands to it

0:05:24.720,0:05:27.520
and all that and that was

0:05:26.000,0:05:29.120
somewhat annoying when you were also

0:05:27.520,0:05:30.960
trying to use the computer for something

0:05:29.120,0:05:34.400
else like playing a game or

0:05:30.960,0:05:35.919
work or whatnot and also for hours on

0:05:34.400,0:05:38.960
end that thing would sit next to me

0:05:35.919,0:05:41.120
and produce noises and fumes which also

0:05:38.960,0:05:42.800
i mean they are not that bad but if they

0:05:41.120,0:05:44.960
do it for hours and hours and hours they

0:05:42.800,0:05:47.440
can just go on your nerves

0:05:44.960,0:05:48.639
and yeah so there was a point where i

0:05:47.440,0:05:50.160
figured okay then

0:05:48.639,0:05:51.919
there needs to be some kind of solution

0:05:50.160,0:05:53.919
for this problem i cannot be the only

0:05:51.919,0:05:56.800
one who has ever experienced that

0:05:53.919,0:05:59.120
and so i i i started looking around the

0:05:56.800,0:06:00.800
raspberry pi just come out in that year

0:05:59.120,0:06:02.800
and i looked for something that i could

0:06:00.800,0:06:05.199
just run on a pie and

0:06:02.800,0:06:07.440
put the pie on the on the printer and

0:06:05.199,0:06:09.840
and plug in the wi-fi dongle back then

0:06:07.440,0:06:13.280
the pi did not come with wi-fi on board

0:06:09.840,0:06:15.680
and be able to remotely monitor it and

0:06:13.280,0:06:16.960
remote control it and all that and it

0:06:15.680,0:06:19.759
turned out there was

0:06:16.960,0:06:21.520
simply no such thing yet um there were

0:06:19.759,0:06:23.199
some projects which treated the printer

0:06:21.520,0:06:25.280
like a black box where you would just

0:06:23.199,0:06:26.880
push code there and hope it would get

0:06:25.280,0:06:28.479
printed but you did not know

0:06:26.880,0:06:30.319
if it actually was doing anything there

0:06:28.479,0:06:31.919
was no back channel so to speak and that

0:06:30.319,0:06:33.440
was something that did not work for me

0:06:31.919,0:06:36.960
at all so

0:06:33.440,0:06:40.639
yeah um i was still employed with a big

0:06:36.960,0:06:43.680
uh yeah i t custom solution development

0:06:40.639,0:06:47.280
corporation kind of thing back then

0:06:43.680,0:06:50.639
so i was a coder

0:06:47.280,0:06:53.280
or rather a software architect by day

0:06:50.639,0:06:54.000
and so it came somewhat naturally to me

0:06:53.280,0:06:55.680
to also

0:06:54.000,0:06:57.520
take the opportunity to start up a new

0:06:55.680,0:06:59.520
pet project because it had been a while

0:06:57.520,0:07:01.599
since i last had something like this and

0:06:59.520,0:07:03.039
at work they did not let me that close

0:07:01.599,0:07:04.800
to code anymore because i was too

0:07:03.039,0:07:06.960
expensive or something

0:07:04.800,0:07:08.240
and so over the course of my christmas

0:07:06.960,0:07:10.319
break i sat down

0:07:08.240,0:07:12.000
and wrote up the very very very very

0:07:10.319,0:07:12.639
first version of octoprint which back

0:07:12.000,0:07:16.000
then was

0:07:12.639,0:07:18.960
called i think it even was called cura

0:07:16.000,0:07:20.319
web ui at first because it was forked

0:07:18.960,0:07:22.800
off another project

0:07:20.319,0:07:24.240
that in other soic could you reuse the

0:07:22.800,0:07:25.599
communication layer because i had no

0:07:24.240,0:07:26.560
idea about printer communication back

0:07:25.599,0:07:31.280
then

0:07:26.560,0:07:33.120
and um so i just plugged this on top

0:07:31.280,0:07:35.120
and it worked somehow and then people

0:07:33.120,0:07:37.039
complained that they had to install

0:07:35.120,0:07:38.960
all of cura in order to run that thing

0:07:37.039,0:07:42.400
that i built so extracted it

0:07:38.960,0:07:45.680
and then it took off from there

0:07:42.400,0:07:47.360
so i i i believe so after the

0:07:45.680,0:07:49.039
after the end of my christmas vacation i

0:07:47.360,0:07:50.479
figured okay it's doing everything that

0:07:49.039,0:07:53.599
i wanted to do now

0:07:50.479,0:07:55.680
i'm done with this and just

0:07:53.599,0:07:58.000
went back to my regular job and suddenly

0:07:55.680,0:08:00.000
i started getting emails and and issues

0:07:58.000,0:08:01.759
and all that from all over the world and

0:08:00.000,0:08:03.759
can you make it do that and can you make

0:08:01.759,0:08:05.599
it also do that and hey by the way i

0:08:03.759,0:08:07.120
have this other kind of printer with

0:08:05.599,0:08:08.800
this different kind of firmware

0:08:07.120,0:08:10.479
and it does this and this differently

0:08:08.800,0:08:12.479
and can we maybe make it work with your

0:08:10.479,0:08:14.160
thing as well and

0:08:12.479,0:08:15.599
around that time that was when i

0:08:14.160,0:08:17.440
realized okay

0:08:15.599,0:08:18.639
apparently other people do have the same

0:08:17.440,0:08:21.919
problems as i do

0:08:18.639,0:08:25.280
and i need to maybe

0:08:21.919,0:08:28.160
think about how to make this better

0:08:25.280,0:08:28.639
so it works for everyone and not just me

0:08:28.160,0:08:31.039
and

0:08:28.639,0:08:32.880
yeah that was also when it got an actual

0:08:31.039,0:08:34.640
name and all that

0:08:32.880,0:08:36.479
and what which when you said you did

0:08:34.640,0:08:39.599
over the the holiday season

0:08:36.479,0:08:42.159
what um which holiday season was that

0:08:39.599,0:08:45.200
like how many years ago

0:08:42.159,0:08:48.000
2012. oh it was back then okay

0:08:45.200,0:08:50.240
so okay yeah yeah so so i it started

0:08:48.000,0:08:52.880
over eight years ago

0:08:50.240,0:08:54.080
nice and i think i i did the first

0:08:52.880,0:08:58.480
public post about

0:08:54.080,0:09:01.519
it on uh december 25th 2012.

0:08:58.480,0:09:04.880
got you and um what what technology did

0:09:01.519,0:09:08.160
you use what was it written in

0:09:04.880,0:09:10.240
python yeah so um initially i took a

0:09:08.160,0:09:11.600
look at node.js but back then at least i

0:09:10.240,0:09:13.200
don't know if things are different these

0:09:11.600,0:09:15.920
days but back then

0:09:13.200,0:09:16.560
uh the the um ecosystem simply wasn't

0:09:15.920,0:09:18.080
there yet

0:09:16.560,0:09:20.160
especially not if you were trying to

0:09:18.080,0:09:21.839
stay platform compatible

0:09:20.160,0:09:23.680
across platform compatible which was

0:09:21.839,0:09:25.279
also gold that i had because

0:09:23.680,0:09:27.279
maybe not everyone wants to run it on a

0:09:25.279,0:09:29.600
raspberry pi but on an old laptop or

0:09:27.279,0:09:31.360
something so

0:09:29.600,0:09:32.720
and i also wanted to be able to develop

0:09:31.360,0:09:35.519
it on my

0:09:32.720,0:09:36.240
workstation which to this day still runs

0:09:35.519,0:09:38.000
windows

0:09:36.240,0:09:39.360
because i also am a gamer and i do not

0:09:38.000,0:09:42.480
want to constantly reboot

0:09:39.360,0:09:45.760
just to work or game and

0:09:42.480,0:09:48.080
um yeah so so i did

0:09:45.760,0:09:50.000
so i decided on python and cura was also

0:09:48.080,0:09:53.200
written in python so i could just

0:09:50.000,0:09:55.440
use these parts that i uh still

0:09:53.200,0:09:56.480
have the communication layer built on

0:09:55.440,0:09:59.120
these days

0:09:56.480,0:10:00.720
and go from there and i had learned

0:09:59.120,0:10:04.640
python a couple years ago

0:10:00.720,0:10:07.200
before that when i was so i started

0:10:04.640,0:10:08.640
right after universe so maybe i should

0:10:07.200,0:10:11.040
go a bit back so

0:10:08.640,0:10:12.560
uh after i realized hey coding is like

0:10:11.040,0:10:13.839
lego bricks without running out of

0:10:12.560,0:10:16.079
bricks i decided

0:10:13.839,0:10:18.000
uh i need to do this somehow in my life

0:10:16.079,0:10:19.680
then i learned software engineer is an

0:10:18.000,0:10:20.079
actual job that people can do and from

0:10:19.680,0:10:23.360
that

0:10:20.079,0:10:24.320
point on so maybe like when i was 12 or

0:10:23.360,0:10:27.200
so i was

0:10:24.320,0:10:27.760
dead set on becoming a software engineer

0:10:27.200,0:10:30.560
so

0:10:27.760,0:10:31.279
university was a natural thing to do

0:10:30.560,0:10:34.240
right after

0:10:31.279,0:10:34.640
graduating from school and so i studied

0:10:34.240,0:10:36.240
so

0:10:34.640,0:10:38.480
a software engineer or computer science

0:10:36.240,0:10:41.200
rather and right after that

0:10:38.480,0:10:42.720
i figured i i wasn't really sure yet

0:10:41.200,0:10:44.240
what to do next with my life

0:10:42.720,0:10:46.399
and a position opened up at the

0:10:44.240,0:10:48.399
university to be a system administrator

0:10:46.399,0:10:50.240
and so i did that and this is where i

0:10:48.399,0:10:51.920
learned python properly

0:10:50.240,0:10:53.600
because uh yeah for system

0:10:51.920,0:10:54.720
administration for automating some stuff

0:10:53.600,0:10:57.920
it can be quite

0:10:54.720,0:11:00.240
nice to have and yeah this is basically

0:10:57.920,0:11:03.920
what i then um

0:11:00.240,0:11:05.600
was able to build upon with uh when when

0:11:03.920,0:11:07.200
octoprints started or happened or

0:11:05.600,0:11:10.880
whatever

0:11:07.200,0:11:12.240
and um when did you go full time on

0:11:10.880,0:11:14.240
turrets when did you leave your job and

0:11:12.240,0:11:16.959
go full time to it

0:11:14.240,0:11:18.079
so that was a bit of a process um

0:11:16.959,0:11:21.279
because

0:11:18.079,0:11:24.000
so things exploded right and around uh

0:11:21.279,0:11:26.800
yeah let's say at the start of 20 at the

0:11:24.000,0:11:27.839
middle of 2013 or so it was it got quite

0:11:26.800,0:11:30.000
clear that

0:11:27.839,0:11:31.600
i could not do this completely just in

0:11:30.000,0:11:33.200
my free time anymore because the project

0:11:31.600,0:11:34.959
was just too big and the user base was

0:11:33.200,0:11:38.079
too big and all that

0:11:34.959,0:11:38.720
and so i first talked my employer into

0:11:38.079,0:11:42.399
giving me

0:11:38.720,0:11:43.040
one day off so i reduced my contract to

0:11:42.399,0:11:46.079
80

0:11:43.040,0:11:49.440
at 80 pay obviously and uh

0:11:46.079,0:11:52.240
got them to uh make it make sure that i

0:11:49.440,0:11:54.399
at least could dedicate mondays as well

0:11:52.240,0:11:57.519
to the project

0:11:54.399,0:12:00.079
uh so it went like that until the early

0:11:57.519,0:12:03.120
uh months i think february or march or

0:12:00.079,0:12:05.600
so of 2014 when i realized okay

0:12:03.120,0:12:06.560
this one day per week this is not really

0:12:05.600,0:12:10.160
enough anymore

0:12:06.560,0:12:13.680
and i need to find a way to either

0:12:10.160,0:12:16.880
work full time on this or i

0:12:13.680,0:12:18.880
have to drop this because at this point

0:12:16.880,0:12:19.279
it was become becoming quite unhealthy

0:12:18.880,0:12:21.920
and

0:12:19.279,0:12:23.519
really not sustainable all evenings were

0:12:21.920,0:12:24.639
spent on the project or weekends were

0:12:23.519,0:12:26.399
spent on the project

0:12:24.639,0:12:28.639
most of the vacation days my friends and

0:12:26.399,0:12:30.320
family were a bit of a bit pissed at me

0:12:28.639,0:12:32.959
at this point as well so

0:12:30.320,0:12:34.639
um and i also noticed it in my health

0:12:32.959,0:12:36.240
that i was simply not getting the rest

0:12:34.639,0:12:36.720
that i needed because i was constantly

0:12:36.240,0:12:39.440
just

0:12:36.720,0:12:41.839
either coding on work coding or working

0:12:39.440,0:12:44.240
at work on on stuff or

0:12:41.839,0:12:46.240
working on octoprint and just at that

0:12:44.240,0:12:47.920
time uh suddenly an email found its way

0:12:46.240,0:12:50.240
into my inbox from a company

0:12:47.920,0:12:52.480
a spanish 3d printer company who offered

0:12:50.240,0:12:54.000
to hire me full time to work on

0:12:52.480,0:12:55.680
octoprint because they

0:12:54.000,0:12:57.760
they basically said hey we like what

0:12:55.680,0:13:00.240
you're doing uh we want

0:12:57.760,0:13:01.920
want to invite you here uh to visit us

0:13:00.240,0:13:03.839
and and let's talk maybe

0:13:01.920,0:13:05.600
if you want to get on board with us and

0:13:03.839,0:13:08.480
work full-time on octoprint

0:13:05.600,0:13:09.360
so i said i immediately got on a plane

0:13:08.480,0:13:12.079
to madrid

0:13:09.360,0:13:12.800
and we talked and we came to a

0:13:12.079,0:13:15.279
conclusion

0:13:12.800,0:13:16.320
and this is how i turned it full-time in

0:13:15.279,0:13:20.079
august

0:13:16.320,0:13:22.160
2014. then said company sadly ran

0:13:20.079,0:13:23.120
into some let's call it economical

0:13:22.160,0:13:27.200
difficulties

0:13:23.120,0:13:29.200
in uh in early 2016

0:13:27.200,0:13:30.560
and that was when i suddenly found

0:13:29.200,0:13:33.200
myself with

0:13:30.560,0:13:34.079
a full-time open source project on my

0:13:33.200,0:13:35.839
hand but no

0:13:34.079,0:13:37.279
funding right okay that's quite

0:13:35.839,0:13:39.040
challenging

0:13:37.279,0:13:40.720
yep and this was the point where i

0:13:39.040,0:13:42.480
figured okay uh

0:13:40.720,0:13:43.760
i am deadly afraid of this whole

0:13:42.480,0:13:47.120
situation because

0:13:43.760,0:13:49.040
up on this up up until this point i

0:13:47.120,0:13:50.240
had always been in a regular employment

0:13:49.040,0:13:54.480
situation right so

0:13:50.240,0:13:58.000
i had a contract and salary and all that

0:13:54.480,0:14:01.440
and social security security insurances

0:13:58.000,0:14:02.560
all the all the nine yards of regular

0:14:01.440,0:14:05.920
german

0:14:02.560,0:14:08.000
work life and

0:14:05.920,0:14:08.959
now i had the option of either letting

0:14:08.000,0:14:11.279
octoprint go

0:14:08.959,0:14:13.199
and going back into something like that

0:14:11.279,0:14:14.959
by finding another job which i was

0:14:13.199,0:14:18.720
fairly sure i would quickly find

0:14:14.959,0:14:20.480
given my uh cv or

0:14:18.720,0:14:22.000
and i was quite sure if i did not try

0:14:20.480,0:14:22.320
that i would kick myself for the rest of

0:14:22.000,0:14:25.279
the

0:14:22.320,0:14:27.120
of my life try if i could somehow make

0:14:25.279,0:14:29.839
it work through crowdfunding

0:14:27.120,0:14:30.639
okay and that was when i turned to

0:14:29.839,0:14:34.000
patreon

0:14:30.639,0:14:37.279
and fired up a campaign and

0:14:34.000,0:14:39.279
rallied people to basically yeah put

0:14:37.279,0:14:41.199
their money where their mouth is because

0:14:39.279,0:14:43.120
the project was in crisis and it was

0:14:41.199,0:14:46.160
either that supporting me

0:14:43.120,0:14:49.360
somehow or i had to give up on that

0:14:46.160,0:14:53.600
and yeah

0:14:49.360,0:14:56.079
to my utter surprise it worked so

0:14:53.600,0:14:58.160
people did in fact uh immediately jump

0:14:56.079,0:15:01.839
on this campaign and contributed

0:14:58.160,0:15:03.600
and uh yeah that was quite it was quite

0:15:01.839,0:15:06.000
the awesome experience and to this day

0:15:03.600,0:15:07.120
i cannot really i cannot really grasp it

0:15:06.000,0:15:09.760
really to this day

0:15:07.120,0:15:11.199
like there are thousands of people now

0:15:09.760,0:15:14.160
who

0:15:11.199,0:15:15.839
give as little as a dollar per month or

0:15:14.160,0:15:19.279
as much as 20

0:15:15.839,0:15:22.160
and and simply make it work so that

0:15:19.279,0:15:25.199
the whole mass of of of people together

0:15:22.160,0:15:27.760
makes it so that i can do this full time

0:15:25.199,0:15:28.399
and uh can do this now full time in this

0:15:27.760,0:15:30.720
mode for

0:15:28.399,0:15:32.000
over four years now and this is just

0:15:30.720,0:15:34.959
amazing

0:15:32.000,0:15:35.279
it's stressful and it's it's insane and

0:15:34.959,0:15:38.560
but

0:15:35.279,0:15:39.920
but it's amazing that's so cool and

0:15:38.560,0:15:41.360
you answered my question already i was

0:15:39.920,0:15:42.880
going to ask what sort of donations do

0:15:41.360,0:15:44.720
you get are they around the

0:15:42.880,0:15:46.639
you know the one to twenty or they in

0:15:44.720,0:15:48.959
the hundreds or thousands so

0:15:46.639,0:15:50.800
um it sounds like you go for like small

0:15:48.959,0:15:52.320
donation donations but a bigger amount

0:15:50.800,0:15:55.040
of people

0:15:52.320,0:15:57.199
yeah yeah in general it's like i mean

0:15:55.040,0:15:59.040
there are some i have two

0:15:57.199,0:16:00.800
two legs basically on which i'm standing

0:15:59.040,0:16:03.120
uh donation-wise one side is the

0:16:00.800,0:16:04.800
recurring ones where patreon wire github

0:16:03.120,0:16:08.480
sponsoring by a

0:16:04.800,0:16:11.440
um donor box and libera pay

0:16:08.480,0:16:13.040
okay and those are like smaller things

0:16:11.440,0:16:14.639
but there's also one time donations and

0:16:13.040,0:16:16.959
those sometimes are a bit

0:16:14.639,0:16:18.480
bigger it always depends so like i do

0:16:16.959,0:16:20.160
not make rules there

0:16:18.480,0:16:22.240
people give me how many they want how

0:16:20.160,0:16:24.720
much they can and they want

0:16:22.240,0:16:25.519
and i'm i'm grateful for everything be

0:16:24.720,0:16:28.079
it

0:16:25.519,0:16:30.160
one dollar or be it obviously more than

0:16:28.079,0:16:31.680
one dollar

0:16:30.160,0:16:32.959
that's uh i mean that's it's just

0:16:31.680,0:16:34.399
awesome i know a lot of people i'm

0:16:32.959,0:16:35.199
seeing from the chat now i know a lot of

0:16:34.399,0:16:36.639
people

0:16:35.199,0:16:38.399
you know want to get into open source

0:16:36.639,0:16:40.880
full-time um i know

0:16:38.399,0:16:42.240
that i do a lot of open source as well

0:16:40.880,0:16:43.120
and people know my stories i'm not going

0:16:42.240,0:16:45.519
to go into that

0:16:43.120,0:16:46.480
but it's interesting that you know you

0:16:45.519,0:16:49.680
you've done yours

0:16:46.480,0:16:50.720
via patreon and similar platforms and

0:16:49.680,0:16:52.720
that's worked out

0:16:50.720,0:16:55.279
really well and you've been going strong

0:16:52.720,0:16:58.000
and do you find that as time goes on

0:16:55.279,0:16:58.320
it is uh getting stronger as well as in

0:16:58.000,0:17:01.199
uh

0:16:58.320,0:17:02.560
our other donation are other nations

0:17:01.199,0:17:04.319
overall kind of

0:17:02.560,0:17:06.880
increasing that in the future you might

0:17:04.319,0:17:08.400
be able to potentially hire someone else

0:17:06.880,0:17:11.039
to to help you as well is that a

0:17:08.400,0:17:11.039
possibility

0:17:11.199,0:17:14.880
it's hard to say to be honest so i'm

0:17:13.039,0:17:15.280
hoping that someday this is something

0:17:14.880,0:17:17.839
that

0:17:15.280,0:17:19.439
will be possible though in in germany

0:17:17.839,0:17:21.199
there's a lot of red tape associated

0:17:19.439,0:17:22.559
with actually hiring someone a lot more

0:17:21.199,0:17:25.199
than in other countries

0:17:22.559,0:17:26.240
uh which makes this a bit more tricky uh

0:17:25.199,0:17:28.160
to pull off but

0:17:26.240,0:17:30.400
i hope that maybe someday it will get

0:17:28.160,0:17:34.320
there it is

0:17:30.400,0:17:36.160
fluctuating so okay

0:17:34.320,0:17:39.200
right now it's at a point i would say

0:17:36.160,0:17:42.480
where i'm keeping up with uh

0:17:39.200,0:17:44.720
with uh inflation and all that but uh

0:17:42.480,0:17:45.600
it's always a bit tricky i i alway i

0:17:44.720,0:17:48.720
also have

0:17:45.600,0:17:50.799
started to to try to yeah

0:17:48.720,0:17:52.960
basic basically diversify so that's not

0:17:50.799,0:17:55.679
just donations i'm also

0:17:52.960,0:17:58.840
using ad revenue i uh use uh

0:17:55.679,0:18:02.480
sponsorships by corporations now as well

0:17:58.840,0:18:04.640
um and also stuff like merchandise

0:18:02.480,0:18:05.679
sales though that is like really really

0:18:04.640,0:18:08.960
little

0:18:05.679,0:18:11.679
amount but still this is stuff that i uh

0:18:08.960,0:18:13.039
also have started doing and yeah the

0:18:11.679,0:18:15.679
idea is basically

0:18:13.039,0:18:17.520
the shock of of losing this this this

0:18:15.679,0:18:19.280
gig that i had that allowed me to do it

0:18:17.520,0:18:21.280
full-time because one company couldn't

0:18:19.280,0:18:23.039
afford it anymore has taught me that

0:18:21.280,0:18:24.559
i think if you want this to work in some

0:18:23.039,0:18:25.440
way in open source you really need to

0:18:24.559,0:18:27.360
diversify

0:18:25.440,0:18:28.960
you need to spread it as far and wide as

0:18:27.360,0:18:30.640
possible across as many sources as

0:18:28.960,0:18:33.120
possible so that if one

0:18:30.640,0:18:35.200
cannot do it anymore be it a one dollar

0:18:33.120,0:18:36.960
person or be it a one thousand dollar

0:18:35.200,0:18:38.720
corporation

0:18:36.960,0:18:40.960
it might still hurt but it will not hurt

0:18:38.720,0:18:42.880
as much it will not put the project at

0:18:40.960,0:18:44.880
risk that's very true

0:18:42.880,0:18:46.880
and we've got a question here from

0:18:44.880,0:18:48.400
santosh another github star who was on

0:18:46.880,0:18:49.200
my channel i think last week or the week

0:18:48.400,0:18:52.240
before

0:18:49.200,0:18:53.200
um so if i can maybe generalize this

0:18:52.240,0:18:55.520
question a bit

0:18:53.200,0:18:57.520
i guess from your different sources of

0:18:55.520,0:18:59.840
income what's the percentage that you

0:18:57.520,0:19:01.840
kind of that it makes up your income so

0:18:59.840,0:19:04.240
i'm guessing patreon makes up the

0:19:01.840,0:19:05.039
biggest chunk that you get yeah yep

0:19:04.240,0:19:07.039
definitely

0:19:05.039,0:19:10.080
and then the smallest chunk is is that

0:19:07.039,0:19:12.480
getting to be the the swag sales

0:19:10.080,0:19:13.760
yeah yeah that that would be that i

0:19:12.480,0:19:16.880
guess

0:19:13.760,0:19:19.520
the rest is like in between okay

0:19:16.880,0:19:21.280
why does github sponsors i guess sit in

0:19:19.520,0:19:23.440
in that scale roughly

0:19:21.280,0:19:24.480
um is it catching up with patreon or not

0:19:23.440,0:19:26.320
really

0:19:24.480,0:19:27.840
oh it's far away like it's moment it's

0:19:26.320,0:19:31.520
currently like at uh

0:19:27.840,0:19:35.039
um how do you say like a tenth maybe

0:19:31.520,0:19:37.600
of uh okay off of patreon

0:19:35.039,0:19:39.600
uh but obviously i mean patreon has been

0:19:37.600,0:19:42.000
there longer as well and this was also

0:19:39.600,0:19:45.440
the platform that i started on

0:19:42.000,0:19:48.240
and uh yeah um

0:19:45.440,0:19:48.559
it's just spread across it but but from

0:19:48.240,0:19:50.400
the

0:19:48.559,0:19:52.400
from the one time from the recurring

0:19:50.400,0:19:54.400
donation platforms one

0:19:52.400,0:19:55.919
github sponsor i think is the second

0:19:54.400,0:19:58.240
rank right now for me

0:19:55.919,0:20:00.080
okay okay that sounds with regards to

0:19:58.240,0:20:02.799
what i get back from it yeah

0:20:00.080,0:20:05.039
that sounds good and uh here's a

0:20:02.799,0:20:06.880
question from five iv let me bring it up

0:20:05.039,0:20:08.799
on the screen

0:20:06.880,0:20:10.880
how often does full time open source

0:20:08.799,0:20:12.400
become economically viable is it better

0:20:10.880,0:20:14.000
to do half and half

0:20:12.400,0:20:15.679
or work in paid rolls for a few years

0:20:14.000,0:20:20.000
and then full time open source while

0:20:15.679,0:20:22.240
using save money

0:20:20.000,0:20:24.240
it's tricky i think to be make it become

0:20:22.240,0:20:26.080
economically viable so in my case i

0:20:24.240,0:20:26.960
think i just had a perfect storm of

0:20:26.080,0:20:29.280
having a

0:20:26.960,0:20:30.640
committed community already who had said

0:20:29.280,0:20:33.679
who i had been able to

0:20:30.640,0:20:35.520
to show that i can deliver and that i

0:20:33.679,0:20:40.240
can do a good job

0:20:35.520,0:20:43.760
and uh that i think enabled this to work

0:20:40.240,0:20:45.919
mostly but i cannot really

0:20:43.760,0:20:46.880
say what is the best approach here what

0:20:45.919,0:20:49.200
i

0:20:46.880,0:20:51.760
what i would advise against from a

0:20:49.200,0:20:54.720
sustainability and personal health

0:20:51.760,0:20:55.760
kind of a position is actually to try to

0:20:54.720,0:20:59.280
do it

0:20:55.760,0:21:01.520
at the same time both i mean

0:20:59.280,0:21:03.520
what what what i think is important if

0:21:01.520,0:21:05.919
you do open source and you do not

0:21:03.520,0:21:07.679
do it yet full time then make extra

0:21:05.919,0:21:09.600
extra sure that you do not

0:21:07.679,0:21:11.039
overwork yourself because the last thing

0:21:09.600,0:21:13.600
you want is to i mean

0:21:11.039,0:21:14.240
we do open source at the beginning at

0:21:13.600,0:21:16.960
least and

0:21:14.240,0:21:18.799
i personally still do it for fun right

0:21:16.960,0:21:20.640
because we like growing with it

0:21:18.799,0:21:22.240
and we like helping people and we like

0:21:20.640,0:21:24.000
learning new stuff and we like

0:21:22.240,0:21:26.080
solving problems maybe and playing with

0:21:24.000,0:21:29.440
lego bricks that never run out

0:21:26.080,0:21:31.760
and um so when you

0:21:29.440,0:21:32.480
do that and but you also have to run a

0:21:31.760,0:21:35.200
day job

0:21:32.480,0:21:35.919
it can start to feel like a second job

0:21:35.200,0:21:38.480
and

0:21:35.919,0:21:39.760
it can stop being fun and it can start

0:21:38.480,0:21:42.480
to

0:21:39.760,0:21:44.000
quickly dissolve in or evolve into into

0:21:42.480,0:21:45.360
burnout territory and this is something

0:21:44.000,0:21:46.960
that you have to be really really

0:21:45.360,0:21:48.880
careful of

0:21:46.960,0:21:50.320
so yeah the last thing you want is

0:21:48.880,0:21:51.919
something that you love to be actually

0:21:50.320,0:21:54.559
something you start hating

0:21:51.919,0:21:56.240
that's so very true it's very true it is

0:21:54.559,0:21:57.679
hard work at the beginning i think it's

0:21:56.240,0:21:58.000
just finding that balance so you want to

0:21:57.679,0:21:59.760
work

0:21:58.000,0:22:01.360
hard so you can keep pushing forward but

0:21:59.760,0:22:03.840
like you said not work too hard where

0:22:01.360,0:22:06.480
you burn out and then you start to

0:22:03.840,0:22:08.240
to hate it as well yeah i think you

0:22:06.480,0:22:12.480
should just not try to force it

0:22:08.240,0:22:14.720
because i mean i'm very very much aware

0:22:12.480,0:22:15.919
that what the the situation that i find

0:22:14.720,0:22:19.120
myself in that

0:22:15.919,0:22:20.799
that was like a one of uh one of one of

0:22:19.120,0:22:23.600
a kind situation like

0:22:20.799,0:22:25.200
being able to start out funded by a

0:22:23.600,0:22:28.480
corporation being able to

0:22:25.200,0:22:31.600
grow the project during that and then

0:22:28.480,0:22:33.679
switching to crowdfunding and i'm not

0:22:31.600,0:22:35.280
sure if i had been able to pull this off

0:22:33.679,0:22:37.679
if i hadn't had this

0:22:35.280,0:22:39.520
this almost two years of being able to

0:22:37.679,0:22:43.360
already work on it full time

0:22:39.520,0:22:46.240
in a in a financially secure setting um

0:22:43.360,0:22:46.880
and and proving my worth so to speak and

0:22:46.240,0:22:49.520
also

0:22:46.880,0:22:50.640
laying some ground work that then i

0:22:49.520,0:22:55.360
could

0:22:50.640,0:22:58.400
more easily build up on after

0:22:55.360,0:23:00.000
so yeah okay so uh

0:22:58.400,0:23:02.640
next question is quite an interesting

0:23:00.000,0:23:05.679
one from uh i think it's alex

0:23:02.640,0:23:07.280
says um how do you see the future of

0:23:05.679,0:23:08.000
open source i know everyone knows my

0:23:07.280,0:23:10.559
answer to this

0:23:08.000,0:23:13.760
so i think it's probably uh better for

0:23:10.559,0:23:13.760
for you to go first

0:23:16.320,0:23:20.320
how do i see it or how do i hope to see

0:23:18.159,0:23:20.320
it

0:23:20.720,0:23:24.880
both i suppose let's do both yeah

0:23:23.200,0:23:27.440
realistically

0:23:24.880,0:23:28.880
yeah i mean what maybe maybe something

0:23:27.440,0:23:29.919
in the middle of it so what i really

0:23:28.880,0:23:32.720
hope is that

0:23:29.919,0:23:34.000
uh wait i have to quickly uh fight with

0:23:32.720,0:23:36.480
my

0:23:34.000,0:23:37.120
earpiece again uh what i really hope uh

0:23:36.480,0:23:39.360
happening

0:23:37.120,0:23:41.200
or hope to see happening soon rather

0:23:39.360,0:23:43.679
than later is this

0:23:41.200,0:23:44.799
this this concept of funding open source

0:23:43.679,0:23:46.720
becoming more mainstream

0:23:44.799,0:23:48.640
because right now most people who use

0:23:46.720,0:23:50.720
open source tools and

0:23:48.640,0:23:52.880
this also includes people who use open

0:23:50.720,0:23:55.679
source tools in a commercial setting

0:23:52.880,0:23:56.159
like people working a company building

0:23:55.679,0:23:58.480
stuff

0:23:56.159,0:24:00.000
up on open source tools they rarely seem

0:23:58.480,0:24:02.960
to think about

0:24:00.000,0:24:04.000
how open source gets created and this it

0:24:02.960,0:24:06.159
just does not fall

0:24:04.000,0:24:08.400
from the heavens or something like that

0:24:06.159,0:24:08.880
it gets created by people and people

0:24:08.400,0:24:11.200
need to

0:24:08.880,0:24:12.799
eat and people need to live uh and they

0:24:11.200,0:24:14.559
need a roof above their head and they

0:24:12.799,0:24:15.520
need a bed to sleep in and they also

0:24:14.559,0:24:19.039
need hardware to

0:24:15.520,0:24:20.480
develop that stuff on so um

0:24:19.039,0:24:22.720
this is something that a lot of people

0:24:20.480,0:24:24.559
are still either

0:24:22.720,0:24:26.080
ignoring or simply not thinking about

0:24:24.559,0:24:29.600
and i hope that this

0:24:26.080,0:24:30.559
may be change maybe changes in the

0:24:29.600,0:24:33.520
future and

0:24:30.559,0:24:35.440
that hopefully people also with stuff

0:24:33.520,0:24:36.720
like github sponsors and patreon and all

0:24:35.440,0:24:40.000
that becoming more visible

0:24:36.720,0:24:41.679
in the community um people will become

0:24:40.000,0:24:43.760
more aware that

0:24:41.679,0:24:46.480
in order for open source to move forward

0:24:43.760,0:24:47.520
and to for projects to actually get to a

0:24:46.480,0:24:50.400
point where they

0:24:47.520,0:24:50.960
are like at a professional level and and

0:24:50.400,0:24:54.159
and and

0:24:50.960,0:24:55.679
can it can actually stay at a certain

0:24:54.159,0:24:58.720
level of quality so that they

0:24:55.679,0:25:00.159
also can constantly be considered for

0:24:58.720,0:25:02.720
commercial work and all that

0:25:00.159,0:25:03.520
yeah that they should be funded and we

0:25:02.720,0:25:06.000
cannot just

0:25:03.520,0:25:08.320
always um hope that these people will

0:25:06.000,0:25:10.960
get hired by some company

0:25:08.320,0:25:13.200
because a maybe they do not want to get

0:25:10.960,0:25:14.720
hired by one single company because that

0:25:13.200,0:25:15.840
also puts you in weird positions that

0:25:14.720,0:25:18.320
i've been in myself

0:25:15.840,0:25:19.520
where your company says your your focus

0:25:18.320,0:25:22.159
should be this feature

0:25:19.520,0:25:23.600
but your user base says but your focus

0:25:22.159,0:25:24.960
actually should be that other feature

0:25:23.600,0:25:27.279
and then you're the maintainer in the

0:25:24.960,0:25:29.440
middle and are torn between the two and

0:25:27.279,0:25:31.039
i like okay i do not know what i should

0:25:29.440,0:25:34.080
be working on now

0:25:31.039,0:25:35.840
um so instead of this it

0:25:34.080,0:25:37.600
i think it would be nice if we could

0:25:35.840,0:25:39.039
achieve something like this situation

0:25:37.600,0:25:41.279
where open source developers can

0:25:39.039,0:25:44.720
actually live from what they do

0:25:41.279,0:25:46.799
just by them doing it so from donations

0:25:44.720,0:25:48.720
from sponsorships and all that and not

0:25:46.799,0:25:50.080
by having to rely on being employed

0:25:48.720,0:25:52.960
somewhere

0:25:50.080,0:25:55.360
or having to sell support contracts

0:25:52.960,0:25:57.440
additionally or something because

0:25:55.360,0:25:59.440
if you are already if you already need

0:25:57.440,0:26:01.039
100 of your time working on an open

0:25:59.440,0:26:02.000
source project in order to maintain it

0:26:01.039,0:26:04.720
and

0:26:02.000,0:26:06.320
improve it and all that um then you

0:26:04.720,0:26:08.000
cannot

0:26:06.320,0:26:10.480
where should you find the time to also

0:26:08.000,0:26:15.120
squeeze in paid work then right so

0:26:10.480,0:26:16.640
this is yeah i agree it is hard to

0:26:15.120,0:26:18.159
go back to that balance again as well

0:26:16.640,0:26:20.559
and i think a lot of companies that

0:26:18.159,0:26:21.840
make big money from using open source to

0:26:20.559,0:26:24.240
build their project

0:26:21.840,0:26:25.120
they don't fund a single kind of cent or

0:26:24.240,0:26:27.360
penny or

0:26:25.120,0:26:28.880
or what is it in euros is it sense i

0:26:27.360,0:26:32.960
don't know but i'm supposed to mount

0:26:28.880,0:26:34.480
it we also have sense okay okay cool um

0:26:32.960,0:26:35.679
and they don't they don't even think

0:26:34.480,0:26:36.000
about that they just think well this is

0:26:35.679,0:26:38.480
just

0:26:36.000,0:26:40.000
a product that probably a big company is

0:26:38.480,0:26:41.279
who's got loads of money like microsoft

0:26:40.000,0:26:42.240
google they can do this for free it's

0:26:41.279,0:26:43.840
fine yeah

0:26:42.240,0:26:45.440
i might see that i even get that with

0:26:43.840,0:26:47.360
octoprint really

0:26:45.440,0:26:48.640
so i i yeah i get a lot of people who

0:26:47.360,0:26:51.520
are like

0:26:48.640,0:26:52.000
yeah the team of octoprint all these

0:26:51.520,0:26:54.240
guys

0:26:52.000,0:26:56.240
and also people think octoprint is done

0:26:54.240,0:26:59.520
by i don't know how many people

0:26:56.240,0:26:59.919
20 or so all of which obviously are only

0:26:59.520,0:27:04.080
male

0:26:59.919,0:27:05.520
of course or even like a whole company

0:27:04.080,0:27:09.200
and then when people learn

0:27:05.520,0:27:13.360
um wait it's primarily me

0:27:09.200,0:27:15.760
also i'm female hi they are like what

0:27:13.360,0:27:17.360
so yeah that a lot of people just don't

0:27:15.760,0:27:18.320
think about it i think and they just

0:27:17.360,0:27:20.960
don't

0:27:18.320,0:27:22.559
try to figure out who even makes their

0:27:20.960,0:27:24.559
the the projects that they run

0:27:22.559,0:27:26.159
which is kind of ever since i found

0:27:24.559,0:27:27.520
myself in this situation i've started

0:27:26.159,0:27:30.559
actually trying to figure out who

0:27:27.520,0:27:31.200
makes the projects that i use so that's

0:27:30.559,0:27:33.760
been an

0:27:31.200,0:27:35.600
educated educational experience as well

0:27:33.760,0:27:37.679
i have to say

0:27:35.600,0:27:38.799
yeah i think i think it's the people who

0:27:37.679,0:27:40.640
do the hands-on are going to have more

0:27:38.799,0:27:42.159
of an appreciation for the other open

0:27:40.640,0:27:43.360
source projects that they use

0:27:42.159,0:27:44.640
but the people who hold the purse

0:27:43.360,0:27:46.720
strings in the company are never going

0:27:44.640,0:27:49.440
to look down at the details

0:27:46.720,0:27:50.720
of um of the products that are being

0:27:49.440,0:27:54.080
used they don't they don't

0:27:50.720,0:27:55.840
kind of care what pit package or npm

0:27:54.080,0:27:57.520
package is being used and should

0:27:55.840,0:27:58.880
should they fund you know should they

0:27:57.520,0:28:00.080
donate to those projects and i think

0:27:58.880,0:28:00.799
that's something that hopefully in the

0:28:00.080,0:28:04.559
future

0:28:00.799,0:28:07.120
can uh can change i hope so too

0:28:04.559,0:28:09.039
i think it would it would lead to quite

0:28:07.120,0:28:10.640
a boom in open source i mean

0:28:09.039,0:28:12.960
the whole internet is built on open

0:28:10.640,0:28:16.480
source uh our smartphones

0:28:12.960,0:28:18.720
are primarily built on open source

0:28:16.480,0:28:20.000
you would think that at this point there

0:28:18.720,0:28:23.039
would be

0:28:20.000,0:28:25.679
like a better business model than hoping

0:28:23.039,0:28:26.799
that people give you money out of their

0:28:25.679,0:28:29.440
out of the bottom of their hearts

0:28:26.799,0:28:31.200
basically um so and it's the people that

0:28:29.440,0:28:32.080
give the money and not the people that

0:28:31.200,0:28:33.679
are

0:28:32.080,0:28:35.200
you know the big players in the

0:28:33.679,0:28:36.720
companies that probably haven't had

0:28:35.200,0:28:38.000
money yeah i find quite interesting it's

0:28:36.720,0:28:40.080
people who are

0:28:38.000,0:28:41.919
you know in the tech and and so forth

0:28:40.080,0:28:42.320
who are sharing their hard-earned money

0:28:41.919,0:28:43.919
exactly

0:28:42.320,0:28:45.919
the people who have earning hundreds of

0:28:43.919,0:28:47.600
thousands a year they're not interested

0:28:45.919,0:28:49.679
they don't care it's kind of

0:28:47.600,0:28:51.039
below them not in a bad way but it's

0:28:49.679,0:28:51.840
just something they don't kind of care

0:28:51.039,0:28:54.399
about

0:28:51.840,0:28:55.520
um yeah yeah hopefully that's something

0:28:54.399,0:28:58.799
we can we can all

0:28:55.520,0:29:00.640
change and improve on so

0:28:58.799,0:29:02.799
oh was i pressed damn it eddie you broke

0:29:00.640,0:29:02.799
it

0:29:03.039,0:29:07.600
no nobody look never look okay i fixed

0:29:04.559,0:29:09.039
it i fixed it yeah you'll find it okay

0:29:07.600,0:29:10.960
i pressed the wrong button on the stream

0:29:09.039,0:29:13.200
deck gotta get used to my new

0:29:10.960,0:29:14.880
back to being into my new office uh

0:29:13.200,0:29:16.000
let's have a have a look um actually

0:29:14.880,0:29:17.520
before we go on to this question i just

0:29:16.000,0:29:19.600
want to say one one thing

0:29:17.520,0:29:21.440
um this is one thing that when people

0:29:19.600,0:29:23.760
say hey eddie i'd love to donate you

0:29:21.440,0:29:25.840
donate to you on github sponsors and

0:29:23.760,0:29:27.039
sometimes i ask this and or if they say

0:29:25.840,0:29:28.799
it they'll say i'm gonna donate five

0:29:27.039,0:29:30.080
dollars to you one thing i do say is i

0:29:28.799,0:29:32.320
i really appreciate that thank you so

0:29:30.080,0:29:34.080
much but if you can donate five dollars

0:29:32.320,0:29:35.919
maybe just give me one dollar and donate

0:29:34.080,0:29:36.880
the other four to four other people in

0:29:35.919,0:29:40.000
the open source

0:29:36.880,0:29:42.000
um community and i i because for me one

0:29:40.000,0:29:44.159
dollar and five dollars yes there's a

0:29:42.000,0:29:46.640
five times value difference

0:29:44.159,0:29:48.080
but i don't know i'd love other people

0:29:46.640,0:29:50.080
to get that because just that one dollar

0:29:48.080,0:29:51.760
still gives me the motivation to kind of

0:29:50.080,0:29:53.600
you know do more and keep going

0:29:51.760,0:29:54.880
even when people share things on social

0:29:53.600,0:29:55.520
they don't know about you but i love it

0:29:54.880,0:29:56.960
when

0:29:55.520,0:29:58.799
when if someone took a screenshot of

0:29:56.960,0:30:00.960
this and shared it on socials

0:29:58.799,0:30:02.720
i'm going to give it a like for sure but

0:30:00.960,0:30:04.240
if they add some value that something

0:30:02.720,0:30:05.840
they learned like if they said i love

0:30:04.240,0:30:07.039
this this tip that gina gave is

0:30:05.840,0:30:08.080
something i want to work towards or

0:30:07.039,0:30:09.520
something like that

0:30:08.080,0:30:11.039
then i'm going to retweet that because

0:30:09.520,0:30:11.760
then they're adding it's a bit like open

0:30:11.039,0:30:14.960
source

0:30:11.760,0:30:16.799
they're adding value to the conversation

0:30:14.960,0:30:20.240
no hint there everyone to screenshot

0:30:16.799,0:30:20.240
this and share something that you like

0:30:21.520,0:30:25.600
uh okay sorry so back to this so

0:30:24.200,0:30:28.080
privatization of

0:30:25.600,0:30:29.360
ai invite in open source i don't know

0:30:28.080,0:30:30.559
much about this area i'm not sure about

0:30:29.360,0:30:32.960
you

0:30:30.559,0:30:34.559
me neither sorry okay we'll have to uh

0:30:32.960,0:30:35.919
have to move on um

0:30:34.559,0:30:37.760
if anyone has any thoughts on that do

0:30:35.919,0:30:38.880
share it in the in the chat do answer

0:30:37.760,0:30:40.159
each other's questions in the chat

0:30:38.880,0:30:41.679
because it is quite interesting

0:30:40.159,0:30:43.600
and while you're there give this video a

0:30:41.679,0:30:44.559

0:30:43.600,0:30:47.360
already

0:30:44.559,0:30:49.039
and gina's details are in the

0:30:47.360,0:30:51.200
description below so you can go follow

0:30:49.039,0:30:55.039
on socials and and so forth and

0:30:51.200,0:30:56.480
find out what exciting stuff is going on

0:30:55.039,0:30:57.440
uh let's have a look what else have we

0:30:56.480,0:30:59.200
got in the chat hopefully i haven't

0:30:57.440,0:31:00.480
missed too many questions if i have copy

0:30:59.200,0:31:03.600
and paste them

0:31:00.480,0:31:05.440
again uh here's a question uh

0:31:03.600,0:31:06.960
by five ivy which is quite interesting

0:31:05.440,0:31:12.080
is quite a kind of a general

0:31:06.960,0:31:15.360
open source question uh about security

0:31:12.080,0:31:17.039
should people um find out about what

0:31:15.360,0:31:18.320
software they're using from a security

0:31:17.039,0:31:20.559
perspective

0:31:18.320,0:31:22.320
oh definitely definitely and i'm

0:31:20.559,0:31:25.519
actually kind of shocked

0:31:22.320,0:31:29.120
that so many companies aren't so

0:31:25.519,0:31:31.120
um i mean i should probably not

0:31:29.120,0:31:33.679
complain too loudly about that because i

0:31:31.120,0:31:34.880
also i mean i look at the stuff that i

0:31:33.679,0:31:37.200
use but i do not

0:31:34.880,0:31:38.399
look completely down the dependency tree

0:31:37.200,0:31:41.440
on everything right

0:31:38.399,0:31:43.519
and that can be quite long it's not as

0:31:41.440,0:31:45.440
bad in python as it is in the npm

0:31:43.519,0:31:47.200
ecosystem i gotta say

0:31:45.440,0:31:48.480
so uh whenever i look into the

0:31:47.200,0:31:50.720
dependency folders there

0:31:48.480,0:31:53.120
it's like thousands of packages that's a

0:31:50.720,0:31:55.840
bit insane but

0:31:53.120,0:31:56.799
um yeah so that is really something that

0:31:55.840,0:32:00.080
people should

0:31:56.799,0:32:02.240
be looking at and should also i mean

0:32:00.080,0:32:03.440
my personal opinion is if i am a company

0:32:02.240,0:32:06.159
and i fund my

0:32:03.440,0:32:08.320
company somehow or my build my company

0:32:06.159,0:32:10.720
somehow on open source

0:32:08.320,0:32:12.799
shouldn't i as a company have a very

0:32:10.720,0:32:14.480
very deeply ingrained interest in this

0:32:12.799,0:32:18.000
open source projects

0:32:14.480,0:32:21.600
to continue to be maintained and to

0:32:18.000,0:32:24.000
get fixes and to see security fixes

0:32:21.600,0:32:24.640
also and also maybe to see new features

0:32:24.000,0:32:27.679
and all that

0:32:24.640,0:32:30.640
because that would be my logic

0:32:27.679,0:32:30.960
where i in this position as for example

0:32:30.640,0:32:34.240
as

0:32:30.960,0:32:36.799
a cto or something um because

0:32:34.240,0:32:38.880
building my company on something that i

0:32:36.799,0:32:41.039
do not control in any way

0:32:38.880,0:32:42.000
not even in this in the tiny tiny way

0:32:41.039,0:32:45.760
where i shove

0:32:42.000,0:32:49.120
money in its general direction is a bit

0:32:45.760,0:32:53.120
i don't know not really

0:32:49.120,0:32:57.360
careful not really good planning like

0:32:53.120,0:32:59.600
very risky yeah i think a lot of people

0:32:57.360,0:33:02.080
don't worry about things until they

0:32:59.600,0:33:03.679
start something breaks or screams and

0:33:02.080,0:33:05.200
and so on i see a lot of companies don't

0:33:03.679,0:33:06.159
worry about like automated testing don't

0:33:05.200,0:33:07.360
worry about

0:33:06.159,0:33:09.200
you know penetration testing or

0:33:07.360,0:33:10.000
accessibility until something goes wrong

0:33:09.200,0:33:14.559
and by then it's

0:33:10.000,0:33:14.559
it's too late anyway yeah

0:33:14.640,0:33:18.480
the same goes for a library that no

0:33:16.960,0:33:20.399
longer gets

0:33:18.480,0:33:21.840
not no longer sees updates right i mean

0:33:20.399,0:33:22.840
we don't do not even have to look at

0:33:21.840,0:33:27.200
security for that

0:33:22.840,0:33:29.679
to be painful possibly

0:33:27.200,0:33:31.600
true um i had a question i've just

0:33:29.679,0:33:33.760
forgotten oh yes github stars so

0:33:31.600,0:33:35.039
i know people always ask me how i became

0:33:33.760,0:33:36.320
a github star and my thoughts and

0:33:35.039,0:33:36.960
they've heard me share this like 100

0:33:36.320,0:33:39.360
times

0:33:36.960,0:33:40.080
so i'd love to hear it uh you know the

0:33:39.360,0:33:42.640
story of

0:33:40.080,0:33:43.840
how it became about and i don't know

0:33:42.640,0:33:45.200
anything else you want to share on that

0:33:43.840,0:33:47.120
really

0:33:45.200,0:33:48.720
i'm not really sure if there is big that

0:33:47.120,0:33:51.600
big of a story to it because

0:33:48.720,0:33:53.679
i just suddenly found uh an invite in my

0:33:51.600,0:33:55.679
in my in my email box and was like

0:33:53.679,0:33:57.200
huh what is that some kind of new

0:33:55.679,0:33:58.720
program that i haven't heard about and

0:33:57.200,0:34:00.320
then i took a look at it and i

0:33:58.720,0:34:02.480
was like okay that sounds interesting

0:34:00.320,0:34:04.480
because um not only is it

0:34:02.480,0:34:06.080
kind of appreciation for yourself that

0:34:04.480,0:34:08.240
you know apparently what you're doing

0:34:06.080,0:34:09.200
means and matters in a way that it gets

0:34:08.240,0:34:11.599
recognized

0:34:09.200,0:34:12.480
uh by a company like github but it also

0:34:11.599,0:34:15.599
gives

0:34:12.480,0:34:18.480
me basically a back channel to people

0:34:15.599,0:34:20.079
that uh or whose product and whose

0:34:18.480,0:34:22.399
platform i daily interact with

0:34:20.079,0:34:23.200
so that has been really really nice on

0:34:22.399,0:34:27.040
both both

0:34:23.200,0:34:29.599
both sides and um yeah so when i

0:34:27.040,0:34:30.560
when i got the invite i was like oh that

0:34:29.599,0:34:32.879
would be awesome

0:34:30.560,0:34:34.480
and then i actually got the confirmation

0:34:32.879,0:34:38.159
and the day the confirmation arrived

0:34:34.480,0:34:38.159
that i was now a github star i was like

0:34:38.960,0:34:43.440
i'm still waiting for my care package

0:34:40.560,0:34:45.520
because some stuff got delayed but yeah

0:34:43.440,0:34:47.520
but it's okay i mean

0:34:45.520,0:34:49.280
things go as they are you can watch a

0:34:47.520,0:34:50.800
youtube video on me unboxing mine if you

0:34:49.280,0:34:53.919
want i mean that i thought that was

0:34:50.800,0:34:55.679
yeah i i i i was i was actually thinking

0:34:53.919,0:34:57.280
about that but then figured uh maybe i

0:34:55.679,0:34:58.800
will just maybe that will make the

0:34:57.280,0:35:00.720
weight harder you know you will that's

0:34:58.800,0:35:03.359
what i was saying

0:35:00.720,0:35:04.480
so so i'm i'm going to just wait a bit

0:35:03.359,0:35:07.119
uh longer

0:35:04.480,0:35:08.560
on whenever it arrives i'm also still

0:35:07.119,0:35:12.160
waiting for my um

0:35:08.560,0:35:14.800
github community star award thing what

0:35:12.160,0:35:16.079
okay actually no i'm maybe i'm waiting

0:35:14.800,0:35:17.760
for that one as well

0:35:16.079,0:35:19.040
i think you you probably are as well i

0:35:17.760,0:35:20.160
think they are getting printed at the

0:35:19.040,0:35:22.640
same time or something

0:35:20.160,0:35:25.040
yes yeah that's the the 3d printing of

0:35:22.640,0:35:26.880
our green bars right

0:35:25.040,0:35:28.880
i know the other one the one that we got

0:35:26.880,0:35:30.400
at the norway

0:35:28.880,0:35:32.079
there's so many so much swag they're

0:35:30.400,0:35:33.280
sending us i lose track every every day

0:35:32.079,0:35:37.040
i wake up

0:35:33.280,0:35:38.880
has arrived i only have got two so far

0:35:37.040,0:35:40.880
but

0:35:38.880,0:35:42.800
right but they were awesome i mean i

0:35:40.880,0:35:45.520
mean the light is from from from them

0:35:42.800,0:35:46.480
and their mic is from them and the pop

0:35:45.520,0:35:48.880
filters from them

0:35:46.480,0:35:49.839
so sure and the water bottle you got the

0:35:48.880,0:35:51.040
water bottle right

0:35:49.839,0:35:53.599
was that the water i also got the water

0:35:51.040,0:35:56.839
bottle he did so so i gotta say i

0:35:53.599,0:35:58.160
i really love mine that i already have

0:35:56.839,0:36:00.079
so

0:35:58.160,0:36:01.680
awesome but i have it and i i like i

0:36:00.079,0:36:03.359
like having stuff that is awesome

0:36:01.680,0:36:05.040
yeah and then you're hanging out with

0:36:03.359,0:36:07.119
the other github stars and being in the

0:36:05.040,0:36:08.720
in the github slack and nova conference

0:36:07.119,0:36:10.720
and help each other on the slack that's

0:36:08.720,0:36:12.720
also really nice i found so like

0:36:10.720,0:36:15.200
i have this problem does someone have an

0:36:12.720,0:36:17.760
idea yeah try this oh it works thank you

0:36:15.200,0:36:19.040
so this is really awesome exactly and i

0:36:17.760,0:36:19.359
know i wouldn't have met you really

0:36:19.040,0:36:22.000
because

0:36:19.359,0:36:24.960
i don't i don't i'm not in the the 3d

0:36:22.000,0:36:26.400
printing space so for me i wouldn't

0:36:24.960,0:36:27.440
you have discovered you and same with

0:36:26.400,0:36:28.800
the other people we've got you know

0:36:27.440,0:36:29.599
santos in in the chat actually i

0:36:28.800,0:36:31.119
probably

0:36:29.599,0:36:32.400
would i knew about santosh i think

0:36:31.119,0:36:33.119
before because of the whole angular

0:36:32.400,0:36:34.880
space

0:36:33.119,0:36:37.680
um so yeah it has worked really well and

0:36:34.880,0:36:40.480
hopefully we can encourage people to

0:36:37.680,0:36:42.240
um you know help more in the community

0:36:40.480,0:36:43.520
so they can potentially become a github

0:36:42.240,0:36:45.680
star in the future

0:36:43.520,0:36:47.040
i think a lot of people think you've got

0:36:45.680,0:36:49.680
to promote

0:36:47.040,0:36:50.480
github i know i do but i don't think you

0:36:49.680,0:36:52.880
or others do

0:36:50.480,0:36:54.640
you use github but you don't you don't

0:36:52.880,0:36:56.160
promote it it's not what you do

0:36:54.640,0:36:57.920
and i think other people then hopefully

0:36:56.160,0:36:59.440
can be made aware that it's just adding

0:36:57.920,0:37:00.079
value i think to the community and open

0:36:59.440,0:37:01.920
source

0:37:00.079,0:37:03.359
which is what puts you on github's radar

0:37:01.920,0:37:06.079
to become a

0:37:03.359,0:37:06.640
potentially a github star at least that

0:37:06.079,0:37:09.839
is my

0:37:06.640,0:37:11.440
impression definitely as well i mean i

0:37:09.839,0:37:13.200
do obviously when i use

0:37:11.440,0:37:14.720
tooling provided by github for example

0:37:13.200,0:37:16.880
when i do stuff with github actions or

0:37:14.720,0:37:18.640
so i i talk about it because

0:37:16.880,0:37:20.160
for me personally it's the right choice

0:37:18.640,0:37:22.720
and i just want to help people

0:37:20.160,0:37:24.560
utilize it as well but that for me this

0:37:22.720,0:37:25.359
does not qualify as promoting that's

0:37:24.560,0:37:27.760
more like

0:37:25.359,0:37:28.560
hey for me this worked maybe it works

0:37:27.760,0:37:33.040
for you as well

0:37:28.560,0:37:33.040
if not then no problem so

0:37:33.839,0:37:36.480
that makes sense okay we've got some

0:37:34.960,0:37:38.079
more questions coming in so i'm getting

0:37:36.480,0:37:38.560
a bit behind so i want to bring these up

0:37:38.079,0:37:40.560
so

0:37:38.560,0:37:42.640
i'm not contributing to bigger projects

0:37:40.560,0:37:43.599
and if i see myself as a potential

0:37:42.640,0:37:44.960
employee

0:37:43.599,0:37:47.119
don't think any recruiter would be

0:37:44.960,0:37:51.839
impressed by any kind of my quality of

0:37:47.119,0:37:54.320
contributions any tips

0:37:51.839,0:37:55.599
a recruiter that actually looks at open

0:37:54.320,0:37:58.240
source contributions i

0:37:55.599,0:38:00.079
think will not really care about whether

0:37:58.240,0:38:01.599
the project is big but rather whether

0:38:00.079,0:38:04.560
the contribution

0:38:01.599,0:38:06.640
makes sense and adds value so i would

0:38:04.560,0:38:08.480
not worry about that too much personally

0:38:06.640,0:38:09.920
i mean i would do that if i was a

0:38:08.480,0:38:12.320
recruiter i would not look at

0:38:09.920,0:38:14.079
did this person contribute to i don't

0:38:12.320,0:38:16.640
know this big note library

0:38:14.079,0:38:19.520
or did they maybe just create a single

0:38:16.640,0:38:22.640
tiny tool that solves one specific

0:38:19.520,0:38:25.280
tiny problem but solves it well

0:38:22.640,0:38:27.599
or maybe they contributed a bug fix to a

0:38:25.280,0:38:28.079
tiny tool that's also problem so i think

0:38:27.599,0:38:32.160
this is

0:38:28.079,0:38:35.280
it's it's it's more important i think to

0:38:32.160,0:38:37.839
contribute value than what project you

0:38:35.280,0:38:39.359
contribute that value to

0:38:37.839,0:38:41.359
at least i hope this is also how

0:38:39.359,0:38:43.440
recruiters see it

0:38:41.359,0:38:44.800
um if they don't personally i would not

0:38:43.440,0:38:46.720
want to work for them

0:38:44.800,0:38:48.320
but yeah true i think a lot of

0:38:46.720,0:38:51.119
recruiters just look at

0:38:48.320,0:38:51.599
is your profile busy lots of green but

0:38:51.119,0:38:54.800
they don't

0:38:51.599,0:38:56.560
yeah deeper until i do because i do

0:38:54.800,0:38:57.599
recommend to people to have an active

0:38:56.560,0:38:59.520
profile with

0:38:57.599,0:39:00.720
you know a fair amount of green because

0:38:59.520,0:39:02.320
the first impression

0:39:00.720,0:39:03.599
and then hopefully later on a hiring

0:39:02.320,0:39:04.000
manager is going to dig deeper and

0:39:03.599,0:39:07.119
actually

0:39:04.000,0:39:09.359
look at the the value added but yeah i

0:39:07.119,0:39:11.359
don't think a recruiter is ever going to

0:39:09.359,0:39:12.960
dig deeper or understand what a good

0:39:11.359,0:39:14.800
issue is or what a good pull request is

0:39:12.960,0:39:18.000
or anything like that

0:39:14.800,0:39:19.599
um so yeah it is

0:39:18.000,0:39:21.280
it is a challenge but i think a lot of

0:39:19.599,0:39:21.599
them are becoming more aware of it

0:39:21.280,0:39:23.359
though

0:39:21.599,0:39:24.720
as in hopefully they'll educate

0:39:23.359,0:39:28.400
themselves a bit to at least

0:39:24.720,0:39:30.800
look a little bit further into it

0:39:28.400,0:39:31.680
i would hope so because i mean getting a

0:39:30.800,0:39:34.800
really green

0:39:31.680,0:39:38.240
guitar profile is like uh

0:39:34.800,0:39:39.760
one cron job away and i mean you can

0:39:38.240,0:39:42.800
completely automate that

0:39:39.760,0:39:44.079
so it's it's it says absolutely nothing

0:39:42.800,0:39:46.560
as long as you do not

0:39:44.079,0:39:47.280
actually dig into what these green dots

0:39:46.560,0:39:50.000
consist of

0:39:47.280,0:39:51.599
and in that moment yeah true but i don't

0:39:50.000,0:39:52.960
recommend anyone automating it because

0:39:51.599,0:39:53.920
for me when i'm reviewing someone's

0:39:52.960,0:39:56.400
profile yes

0:39:53.920,0:39:57.680
if it's more green i think it looks more

0:39:56.400,0:39:59.119
impressive i'm going to dig deeper but

0:39:57.680,0:40:00.240
as soon as i find out something's

0:39:59.119,0:40:03.359
automated like that

0:40:00.240,0:40:05.359
i discard their entire application

0:40:03.359,0:40:07.200
i literally just yeah i would also not

0:40:05.359,0:40:09.040
recommend i mean what you can do

0:40:07.200,0:40:10.560
you can do that for fun if you just want

0:40:09.040,0:40:13.520
to play around with it right

0:40:10.560,0:40:14.800
on a throwaway profile if you just want

0:40:13.520,0:40:18.000
to figure out how it works

0:40:14.800,0:40:19.680
like for experimenting yeah

0:40:18.000,0:40:21.119
but in general no i would not do that on

0:40:19.680,0:40:25.599
my profile

0:40:21.119,0:40:28.880
me neither and i would also not i mean

0:40:25.599,0:40:30.400
i would also refrain from doing drive-by

0:40:28.880,0:40:32.240
pull requests or something like that

0:40:30.400,0:40:34.560
just to have activity

0:40:32.240,0:40:36.240
right because this is also if you just

0:40:34.560,0:40:38.400
fix a typo somewhere which wasn't

0:40:36.240,0:40:41.280
actually a typo or

0:40:38.400,0:40:43.520
so like the typical commits that you get

0:40:41.280,0:40:45.680
during hacktoberfest when people try to

0:40:43.520,0:40:46.400
pad their profiles up so that they can

0:40:45.680,0:40:48.079
reach these

0:40:46.400,0:40:49.520
so these kind of commits they are not

0:40:48.079,0:40:51.680
really actually

0:40:49.520,0:40:52.640
those that are not actually adding value

0:40:51.680,0:40:55.200
you should not

0:40:52.640,0:40:57.680
try to do them i think just to make your

0:40:55.200,0:41:00.960
profile more green you should just

0:40:57.680,0:41:01.359
add value be yourself and if it's a fit

0:41:00.960,0:41:02.800
if

0:41:01.359,0:41:04.480
it's a fit and if it's not a fit and

0:41:02.800,0:41:06.880
it's not a fit and i don't think it

0:41:04.480,0:41:08.880
makes sense to try to be

0:41:06.880,0:41:10.400
something or someone you're not just in

0:41:08.880,0:41:12.000
order to get hired in some position

0:41:10.400,0:41:14.560
where you then will hate it because they

0:41:12.000,0:41:17.599
assumed you were someone else and also

0:41:14.560,0:41:19.599
you should not force yourself to work or

0:41:17.599,0:41:20.000
try to work on big projects which are

0:41:19.599,0:41:22.319
already

0:41:20.000,0:41:24.079
drowning in contributors anyhow probably

0:41:22.319,0:41:25.760
because they are way more high profile

0:41:24.079,0:41:28.319
and people think that they can pet

0:41:25.760,0:41:29.440
maybe also their cb with that and

0:41:28.319,0:41:31.040
instead

0:41:29.440,0:41:34.079
there are a lot of low hanging fruits

0:41:31.040,0:41:35.440
all over the the open source community

0:41:34.079,0:41:37.119
contributing to projects that

0:41:35.440,0:41:39.920
desperately need help

0:41:37.119,0:41:41.440
and would probably love help in any

0:41:39.920,0:41:44.000
shape or form and

0:41:41.440,0:41:44.560
yeah just tackling that kind of stuff

0:41:44.000,0:41:48.000
would

0:41:44.560,0:41:51.280
also help you to have a busy profile and

0:41:48.000,0:41:54.960
learn and discover new technologies

0:41:51.280,0:41:56.880
and find new friends as well a lot of

0:41:54.960,0:41:58.880
i met quite a number of friends during

0:41:56.880,0:42:02.319
open source work

0:41:58.880,0:42:04.480
and yeah would not make you

0:42:02.319,0:42:05.599
feel so stressed all the time yeah i

0:42:04.480,0:42:06.960
agree i think a lot of those bigger

0:42:05.599,0:42:08.960
projects people want to put on their cv

0:42:06.960,0:42:09.520
i contributed to react or whatever they

0:42:08.960,0:42:11.760
move so

0:42:09.520,0:42:12.640
fast that you get disheartened a lot as

0:42:11.760,0:42:14.400
your pr just

0:42:12.640,0:42:15.760
ends up with lots of conflicts and you

0:42:14.400,0:42:16.720
know you're just kind of you're you're a

0:42:15.760,0:42:18.160
smaller

0:42:16.720,0:42:19.920
what's the expression you're you're a

0:42:18.160,0:42:21.119
smaller kind of

0:42:19.920,0:42:23.119
piece of the puzzle i don't know what

0:42:21.119,0:42:24.960
the expression is commit

0:42:23.119,0:42:26.800
no yeah i think there's nothing to do

0:42:24.960,0:42:28.240
with cogs like you're a smaller

0:42:26.800,0:42:30.079
cog in the wheel or something i don't

0:42:28.240,0:42:32.240
know but like it's you you're you know

0:42:30.079,0:42:33.440
yeah yeah yeah requests going on that

0:42:32.240,0:42:36.319
yours is just

0:42:33.440,0:42:38.240
you know if you contribute to a project

0:42:36.319,0:42:40.480
like you said that's moving slower

0:42:38.240,0:42:41.680
and that welcomes contributions more and

0:42:40.480,0:42:43.280
maybe getting a pull request

0:42:41.680,0:42:44.400
like three pull requests a week then

0:42:43.280,0:42:46.079
yours are gonna get more attention

0:42:44.400,0:42:47.440
whereas when you contribute to a bigger

0:42:46.079,0:42:50.400
project that's maybe getting

0:42:47.440,0:42:51.680
30 pull requests a day then yours is

0:42:50.400,0:42:53.200
going to disappear very quickly maybe

0:42:51.680,0:42:55.119
not they get the attention you won't

0:42:53.200,0:42:58.880
learn as much a network as much as

0:42:55.119,0:43:00.880
you need exactly so it's true

0:42:58.880,0:43:02.720
so um i'm not sure if we can we can if

0:43:00.880,0:43:05.599
this is a question or not

0:43:02.720,0:43:07.040
um the dependency chart of everything as

0:43:05.599,0:43:07.839
we mentioned yeah just goes deeper and

0:43:07.040,0:43:10.240
deeper

0:43:07.839,0:43:13.680
and i think uh as juno was saying you

0:43:10.240,0:43:15.839
cannot go all to the nth level of it

0:43:13.680,0:43:16.800
i think it's just you would like to

0:43:15.839,0:43:18.800
think that you trust

0:43:16.800,0:43:20.560
the projects you include and they trust

0:43:18.800,0:43:22.079
the projects they include i'm guessing

0:43:20.560,0:43:24.800
and so on i'm not sure

0:43:22.079,0:43:26.800
if that's a safe bet or not but it's

0:43:24.800,0:43:28.800
probably not

0:43:26.800,0:43:30.000
um but let's just assume it is so we

0:43:28.800,0:43:31.520
cannot sleep at night

0:43:30.000,0:43:32.960
that's true and i think the github is

0:43:31.520,0:43:34.240
doing a lot of great work with security

0:43:32.960,0:43:38.240
and there are other platforms

0:43:34.240,0:43:39.520
uh as well yeah definitely

0:43:38.240,0:43:41.119
uh this is an interesting question

0:43:39.520,0:43:42.720
someone asked me this the other day and

0:43:41.119,0:43:46.079
it definitely took me back

0:43:42.720,0:43:48.800
so gina what was your first open source

0:43:46.079,0:43:48.800
contribution

0:43:49.200,0:43:53.680
i think the official first open source

0:43:51.359,0:43:54.240
contribution to someone else's project

0:43:53.680,0:43:57.599
was

0:43:54.240,0:43:59.520
um i was quite have acquired

0:43:57.599,0:44:00.800
a crime regular now that that's the word

0:43:59.520,0:44:03.680
that i was looking for

0:44:00.800,0:44:04.720
was a quite regular um contributor back

0:44:03.680,0:44:06.720
in the day

0:44:04.720,0:44:08.079
at the dockerwiki project which is like

0:44:06.720,0:44:10.800
a wiki engine php

0:44:08.079,0:44:13.119
based um this is also how i met one of

0:44:10.800,0:44:15.119
my best friends

0:44:13.119,0:44:16.480
who is the who's who's the maintainer of

0:44:15.119,0:44:19.040
the project and

0:44:16.480,0:44:19.599
andreas from whom i learned a lot um

0:44:19.040,0:44:21.359
about

0:44:19.599,0:44:23.040
maintaining open source projects and and

0:44:21.359,0:44:23.680
also yeah i got to meet a couple of

0:44:23.040,0:44:26.960
times

0:44:23.680,0:44:28.880
so um that was yeah one of the

0:44:26.960,0:44:30.880
i think i first started writing plug-ins

0:44:28.880,0:44:34.640
for that and then i started pulling

0:44:30.880,0:44:36.880
i i wrote my first ever fix for some bug

0:44:34.640,0:44:39.920
in the engine itself and

0:44:36.880,0:44:41.599
i remember that i was quite um yeah

0:44:39.920,0:44:42.480
thrilled about having the patch get

0:44:41.599,0:44:46.079
accepted

0:44:42.480,0:44:47.040
and yeah so that was fun um and before

0:44:46.079,0:44:49.920
that i actually

0:44:47.040,0:44:52.000
tried i tried to build something like

0:44:49.920,0:44:53.839
dokobiki myself at first before i

0:44:52.000,0:44:55.119
came across toku wiki and that was

0:44:53.839,0:44:56.480
probably my first

0:44:55.119,0:44:59.119
actual open source project with a

0:44:56.480,0:45:01.520
license and all that and even before

0:44:59.119,0:45:04.400
that so that was like when i was back

0:45:01.520,0:45:07.520
when i was still back in school around

0:45:04.400,0:45:10.720
yeah the late 90s and the early 2000s

0:45:07.520,0:45:11.680
so late late late years at school i i

0:45:10.720,0:45:13.440
actually

0:45:11.680,0:45:14.960
wrote some stuff that these days i would

0:45:13.440,0:45:16.560
consider open source but

0:45:14.960,0:45:18.880
they didn't actually have an open source

0:45:16.560,0:45:21.920
license so technically they weren't

0:45:18.880,0:45:24.560
um but yeah so that

0:45:21.920,0:45:27.520
that is a long time ago in a galaxy far

0:45:24.560,0:45:27.520
far away and all of that

0:45:28.560,0:45:31.760
i think we covered this but let me just

0:45:29.839,0:45:33.760
bring it up from five iv

0:45:31.760,0:45:36.480
is it bad if a profile is more green due

0:45:33.760,0:45:38.000
to ci practices of multiple branches for

0:45:36.480,0:45:39.760
every feature

0:45:38.000,0:45:41.920
my understanding is only the default

0:45:39.760,0:45:44.079
branches count

0:45:41.920,0:45:46.000
yeah which is actually something which

0:45:44.079,0:45:47.760
is for me quite upsetting because

0:45:46.000,0:45:49.599
octoprint's default branch is the stable

0:45:47.760,0:45:53.200
branch which only sees merges when

0:45:49.599,0:45:55.280
i put out a release so my my own github

0:45:53.200,0:45:56.160
profile is fairly misleading most of the

0:45:55.280,0:45:57.440
time

0:45:56.160,0:46:00.000
because it looks like i'm not doing

0:45:57.440,0:46:02.560
anything for weeks and when in fact

0:46:00.000,0:46:04.160
i am just not on the main branch yeah

0:46:02.560,0:46:05.040
yeah it jumps then it gets filled up

0:46:04.160,0:46:08.480
then off

0:46:05.040,0:46:10.319
yeah yeah but yeah so

0:46:08.480,0:46:12.240
you you cannot you cannot just jump

0:46:10.319,0:46:14.319
around between branches and do stuff it

0:46:12.240,0:46:17.440
only only stuff to the main branch

0:46:14.319,0:46:20.000
actually counts for that thing so

0:46:17.440,0:46:20.560
you can do whatever you want with your

0:46:20.000,0:46:22.480
ci

0:46:20.560,0:46:24.240
on different branches as long as it's

0:46:22.480,0:46:26.400
not the main branch it will not look bad

0:46:24.240,0:46:28.560
i think

0:46:26.400,0:46:29.920
true yeah exactly and i think um some

0:46:28.560,0:46:33.359
people get upset when they

0:46:29.920,0:46:34.960
um they do a feature that maybe has 10

0:46:33.359,0:46:38.480
commits but when it gets merged into the

0:46:34.960,0:46:38.480
default branch it gets squashed

0:46:40.880,0:46:45.200
people that want clean history right it

0:46:43.440,0:46:47.040
is important too

0:46:45.200,0:46:49.040
it is important i mean i sometimes do

0:46:47.040,0:46:50.480
this as well i guess i gotta admit when

0:46:49.040,0:46:52.960
it's like

0:46:50.480,0:46:54.240
when when each commit is not actually

0:46:52.960,0:46:56.800
yes i know what you're gonna say

0:46:54.240,0:46:58.880
telling a whole story but it's more like

0:46:56.800,0:47:00.800
uh they they do not work

0:46:58.880,0:47:01.920
separate from each other and you have to

0:47:00.800,0:47:04.240
actually com

0:47:01.920,0:47:06.480
apply them all or none at all in order

0:47:04.240,0:47:10.240
for the code to still stay

0:47:06.480,0:47:12.400
sensible yeah

0:47:10.240,0:47:13.440
uh what else so someone's asking about

0:47:12.400,0:47:16.079
github actions

0:47:13.440,0:47:18.000
i don't know much any resources well do

0:47:16.079,0:47:19.359
you use github actions for your project

0:47:18.000,0:47:22.240
you know do you use something else

0:47:19.359,0:47:22.640
a ton a ton i just actually rewrote

0:47:22.240,0:47:24.400
about

0:47:22.640,0:47:26.640
a bot that i use for helping me with the

0:47:24.400,0:47:27.200
issue tracker and made it use github

0:47:26.640,0:47:30.079
actions

0:47:27.200,0:47:32.079
and i wrote my first actions in in in

0:47:30.079,0:47:35.280
node as well for that

0:47:32.079,0:47:37.359
and yeah it's it's i gotta say i i

0:47:35.280,0:47:38.000
currently consider it github actions as

0:47:37.359,0:47:39.440
the hammer to

0:47:38.000,0:47:41.119
every single nail that i encounter

0:47:39.440,0:47:43.839
regarding automation um

0:47:41.119,0:47:45.599
in in the project like labeling of prs

0:47:43.839,0:47:46.160
automatically based on what files are

0:47:45.599,0:47:49.359
touched

0:47:46.160,0:47:52.400
and uh yeah i do stuff like that

0:47:49.359,0:47:55.359
i do tracking of a labeling of issues

0:47:52.400,0:47:59.040
based on certain keywords they contain

0:47:55.359,0:48:01.280
i um also validate uh issues

0:47:59.040,0:48:03.200
like have people actually included the

0:48:01.280,0:48:04.720
bug tracking template for example with a

0:48:03.200,0:48:06.720
github action

0:48:04.720,0:48:08.480
i also close them if they don't contain

0:48:06.720,0:48:10.800
the the issue template after

0:48:08.480,0:48:11.920
14 days with the github action done

0:48:10.800,0:48:14.800
stale

0:48:11.920,0:48:16.160
handling and all that and excessive

0:48:14.800,0:48:20.079
testing set up

0:48:16.160,0:48:22.079
and i have this whole page build set

0:48:20.079,0:48:23.760
up for the plugin repository which is a

0:48:22.079,0:48:26.160
static page powered by jekyll which

0:48:23.760,0:48:26.880
pulls in dynamic data from the statistic

0:48:26.160,0:48:30.079
page

0:48:26.880,0:48:33.200
and and all that and then builds it in

0:48:30.079,0:48:34.640
all while the github actions so i can

0:48:33.200,0:48:35.839
only recommend getting into that stuff

0:48:34.640,0:48:38.240
it's fun

0:48:35.839,0:48:40.559
like really fun like i enjoy when i i

0:48:38.240,0:48:43.040
get to write a new action kind of fun

0:48:40.559,0:48:43.760
it is it is really really awesome uh it

0:48:43.040,0:48:45.280
is just

0:48:43.760,0:48:46.960
because you can write it it just starts

0:48:45.280,0:48:48.079
off with there's so many let me start

0:48:46.960,0:48:49.119
again i've said try to start three

0:48:48.079,0:48:50.720
different sentences

0:48:49.119,0:48:52.000
um there's just so many actions in the

0:48:50.720,0:48:52.400
marketplace that you can use of just

0:48:52.000,0:48:54.240
some

0:48:52.400,0:48:56.160
basic yaml lines and then if you want to

0:48:54.240,0:48:57.440
customize it further then you can use

0:48:56.160,0:48:59.119
you know so many different languages

0:48:57.440,0:49:00.400
like you said node or i think python's

0:48:59.119,0:49:01.680
all supported i'm not sure but there are

0:49:00.400,0:49:04.000
various languages that you can use

0:49:01.680,0:49:05.520
you can use node.docker like you can

0:49:04.000,0:49:08.160
fire up a dock and then you can use

0:49:05.520,0:49:09.680
use whatever uh what i can also

0:49:08.160,0:49:11.680
recommend if someone is

0:49:09.680,0:49:12.960
trying to get into github actions and is

0:49:11.680,0:49:15.280
maybe afraid a bit of

0:49:12.960,0:49:16.400
of getting their feet wet completely

0:49:15.280,0:49:18.960
already with

0:49:16.400,0:49:20.559
note or docker based stuff there is this

0:49:18.960,0:49:23.040
fancy little

0:49:20.559,0:49:24.160
kind of tool kit which is an action

0:49:23.040,0:49:27.599
itself which

0:49:24.160,0:49:30.079
is action slash github dash script

0:49:27.599,0:49:32.160
and that allows you to just throw a

0:49:30.079,0:49:32.720
bunch of javascript into the body of the

0:49:32.160,0:49:35.520
action

0:49:32.720,0:49:37.680
which then gets executed and i use that

0:49:35.520,0:49:39.760
for some labeling actions and that's

0:49:37.680,0:49:40.720
like you you completely write that in

0:49:39.760,0:49:42.559
yaml

0:49:40.720,0:49:44.960
or rather i mean you still write

0:49:42.559,0:49:48.000
javascript but you dump it in the yaml

0:49:44.960,0:49:49.920
and it's just if you just need a one-off

0:49:48.000,0:49:51.359
kind of thing and you cannot really find

0:49:49.920,0:49:53.040
something on a marketplace that fits the

0:49:51.359,0:49:54.800
bill and it's really easy to

0:49:53.040,0:49:57.280
because it's just like two queries

0:49:54.800,0:49:59.920
against the github api and then maybe

0:49:57.280,0:50:00.800
some logic in between or so then this is

0:49:59.920,0:50:02.960
like

0:50:00.800,0:50:04.640
i i constantly use this for for for

0:50:02.960,0:50:07.040
stuff like that all the time and it's

0:50:04.640,0:50:08.480
it's really easy to prototype things

0:50:07.040,0:50:10.319
with that as well if you

0:50:08.480,0:50:12.079
have an idea how something might work

0:50:10.319,0:50:14.720
and maybe we'll put it in a proper

0:50:12.079,0:50:16.000
action after for others to reuse but you

0:50:14.720,0:50:17.680
first want to test if

0:50:16.000,0:50:20.640
if the idea in general works then this

0:50:17.680,0:50:20.640
is also great for that

0:50:21.040,0:50:24.559
yeah it's uh just uh someone's writing

0:50:23.440,0:50:25.920
in the chat that you can use any

0:50:24.559,0:50:26.400
language or docker container exactly

0:50:25.920,0:50:28.319
it's just

0:50:26.400,0:50:29.599
so flexible you can trigger off any

0:50:28.319,0:50:31.359
event in github

0:50:29.599,0:50:32.640
and there's just so many things you can

0:50:31.359,0:50:34.240
do it's it is

0:50:32.640,0:50:35.680
so much fun i think people do games with

0:50:34.240,0:50:37.200
github action so in their read me they

0:50:35.680,0:50:40.240
have like nuts and questions

0:50:37.200,0:50:40.960
and and then oh my god okay it raises an

0:50:40.240,0:50:42.800
issue

0:50:40.960,0:50:44.800
and then the issue will then update that

0:50:42.800,0:50:46.240
the board in the readme and then you

0:50:44.800,0:50:47.599
click on it and so forth it's quite

0:50:46.240,0:50:50.319
quite funny to see

0:50:47.599,0:50:50.720
the things that have people have done um

0:50:50.319,0:50:52.880
i think

0:50:50.720,0:50:54.000
i even see mine sweep which is really

0:50:52.880,0:50:56.160
important oh my god

0:50:54.000,0:50:57.920
i really need to up my readme game i

0:50:56.160,0:51:00.079
think i currently just have a basic list

0:50:57.920,0:51:01.920
of hi i'm gina and i'm doing this

0:51:00.079,0:51:04.559
thank you for your for your attention

0:51:01.920,0:51:06.880
bye-bye um

0:51:04.559,0:51:08.480
yeah yeah i think the read me spend so

0:51:06.880,0:51:09.440
much time on it though just tweaking it

0:51:08.480,0:51:12.880
and

0:51:09.440,0:51:12.880
improving it and and so on

0:51:12.960,0:51:16.160
we we have a great question here

0:51:14.480,0:51:17.599
actually um what are you what are your

0:51:16.160,0:51:20.839
thoughts on these i have i have a

0:51:17.599,0:51:22.880
thought but i'll let you go first

0:51:20.839,0:51:25.119
um if any project doesn't have a license

0:51:22.880,0:51:26.960
is it not considered open source

0:51:25.119,0:51:28.880
not really not legally no because the

0:51:26.960,0:51:31.119
thing is that in order to say something

0:51:28.880,0:51:32.720
is open source the source has to know

0:51:31.119,0:51:34.880
rather there has to be a license that

0:51:32.720,0:51:35.359
actually allows to utilize it in certain

0:51:34.880,0:51:37.920
ways

0:51:35.359,0:51:38.880
so there is a definition by the open

0:51:37.920,0:51:41.440
source initiative

0:51:38.880,0:51:43.119
that says what constitutes an open

0:51:41.440,0:51:44.960
source license and what must

0:51:43.119,0:51:46.640
what it must fulfill and what it must

0:51:44.960,0:51:48.640
not fulfill so for example it does

0:51:46.640,0:51:50.160
it must not restrict your use of the

0:51:48.640,0:51:52.480
software in any way or shape

0:51:50.160,0:51:53.920
so it must not say something like you

0:51:52.480,0:51:55.440
may use this but only in a

0:51:53.920,0:51:56.400
non-commercial setting or so in that

0:51:55.440,0:51:58.160
moment it is not

0:51:56.400,0:52:00.079
under this definition it is not open

0:51:58.160,0:52:01.920
source and

0:52:00.079,0:52:03.760
in case of at least something like

0:52:01.920,0:52:06.640
germany for example we

0:52:03.760,0:52:08.000
have the problem i would not necessarily

0:52:06.640,0:52:10.079
call it a problem but when it comes to

0:52:08.000,0:52:14.400
open source it is an actual problem

0:52:10.079,0:52:16.839
that any kind of created

0:52:14.400,0:52:18.720
things like for example source are

0:52:16.839,0:52:21.680
automatically copyrighted

0:52:18.720,0:52:23.280
so i do not have to apply for copyright

0:52:21.680,0:52:24.960
for copyright for something that i

0:52:23.280,0:52:27.440
created for it to be

0:52:24.960,0:52:29.200
protected under under the law of

0:52:27.440,0:52:32.000
copyright in germany

0:52:29.200,0:52:33.119
so when i just throw some source up on

0:52:32.000,0:52:36.000
github

0:52:33.119,0:52:38.000
it is automatically copyrighted under

0:52:36.000,0:52:41.200
german law and in theory no one

0:52:38.000,0:52:43.119
may use that they may look at it

0:52:41.200,0:52:45.520
but they may not use it and they may not

0:52:43.119,0:52:48.640
copy it and they definitely may not work

0:52:45.520,0:52:50.640
built up upon on it so in order for this

0:52:48.640,0:52:52.319
to be legally viable i have to attach a

0:52:50.640,0:52:53.280
license to it because otherwise it's

0:52:52.319,0:52:55.520
automatically

0:52:53.280,0:52:56.800
protected under a very very restrictive

0:52:55.520,0:53:00.240
one

0:52:56.800,0:53:02.160
so at least i i think in in in the us

0:53:00.240,0:53:03.839
and and also in other countries on the

0:53:02.160,0:53:04.640
in the world it is probably different

0:53:03.839,0:53:06.640
but at least

0:53:04.640,0:53:08.319
in germany maybe even in all of europe

0:53:06.640,0:53:08.720
i'm not entirely sure but there are

0:53:08.319,0:53:11.760
these

0:53:08.720,0:53:14.480
very fine points in copyright law that

0:53:11.760,0:53:15.920
um make you very very aware once you

0:53:14.480,0:53:19.119
actually look into that

0:53:15.920,0:53:21.119
into it a bit uh how important it is to

0:53:19.119,0:53:22.000
actually attach a license to your source

0:53:21.119,0:53:23.599
and not just

0:53:22.000,0:53:24.880
throw it up somewhere and be like do

0:53:23.599,0:53:26.839
whatever you want with it because do

0:53:24.880,0:53:28.880
whatever you want with it is not a

0:53:26.839,0:53:31.040
license i think i remember

0:53:28.880,0:53:31.920
last time i was reading this um and

0:53:31.040,0:53:34.400
again that you're right

0:53:31.920,0:53:36.160
i think it's country specific but if you

0:53:34.400,0:53:38.480
don't put a license on something you

0:53:36.160,0:53:42.319
default to the terms and conditions of

0:53:38.480,0:53:44.480
github and so then it then i think it

0:53:42.319,0:53:45.920
specifies certain countries and you know

0:53:44.480,0:53:47.599
that can't i don't know if it can

0:53:45.920,0:53:48.480
override certain country rules or vice

0:53:47.599,0:53:51.440
versa

0:53:48.480,0:53:52.559
but um it doesn't make it open source so

0:53:51.440,0:53:55.680
you're absolutely right

0:53:52.559,0:53:57.520
and so uh choose a licensed website by

0:53:55.680,0:53:58.960
github has some really good comparisons

0:53:57.520,0:54:00.240
and information so

0:53:58.960,0:54:01.599
yeah i highly recommend people put a

0:54:00.240,0:54:02.960
license on it therefore it is clear and

0:54:01.599,0:54:04.800
you can always change the license later

0:54:02.960,0:54:08.079
if you want that's my understanding

0:54:04.800,0:54:09.359
be careful okay interesting so okay i

0:54:08.079,0:54:10.000
actually gave a talk about this whole

0:54:09.359,0:54:13.280
topic once

0:54:10.000,0:54:15.520
at maker faire in germany um so

0:54:13.280,0:54:17.440
the thing is that what i would recommend

0:54:15.520,0:54:17.920
is if you want to choose a license for

0:54:17.440,0:54:20.000
project

0:54:17.920,0:54:21.920
actually read the license yes it's it's

0:54:20.000,0:54:23.119
a lot of legalese and it is hard to

0:54:21.920,0:54:24.720
understand but

0:54:23.119,0:54:27.680
there are tools online that will help

0:54:24.720,0:54:29.520
you like tldrlegal.com for example has

0:54:27.680,0:54:30.800
all the open source licenses listed and

0:54:29.520,0:54:31.839
you can click on them and it will

0:54:30.800,0:54:34.800
explain

0:54:31.839,0:54:37.440
the basic gist of what is in there like

0:54:34.800,0:54:39.280
allows that in that case of use

0:54:37.440,0:54:41.760
contains liability or doesn't contain

0:54:39.280,0:54:43.520
liability allows resharing or not with

0:54:41.760,0:54:44.799
or without attribution and all that and

0:54:43.520,0:54:45.520
you can look at that and then you have

0:54:44.799,0:54:47.520
to

0:54:45.520,0:54:49.680
think long and hard about whether you

0:54:47.520,0:54:51.760
actually want to license your work under

0:54:49.680,0:54:53.599
that and if you're comfortable

0:54:51.760,0:54:55.839
for example if you choose something like

0:54:53.599,0:54:57.920
the mit license which basically just

0:54:55.839,0:54:59.920
says do whatever you want you just need

0:54:57.920,0:55:01.760
to keep this copyright notice intact and

0:54:59.920,0:55:03.119
you cannot sue me for any damages that

0:55:01.760,0:55:06.240
my code causes

0:55:03.119,0:55:06.960
um you when you use this license you

0:55:06.240,0:55:09.920
have to be

0:55:06.960,0:55:11.280
aware that a company may come take your

0:55:09.920,0:55:14.160
code

0:55:11.280,0:55:16.480
and build a multi-million dollar a

0:55:14.160,0:55:17.280
company off of it or product off of it

0:55:16.480,0:55:19.119
and you will get

0:55:17.280,0:55:20.720
not a single dime and not even actual

0:55:19.119,0:55:21.920
recognition and you need to be aware

0:55:20.720,0:55:23.599
that this can happen

0:55:21.920,0:55:25.839
i mean the likelihood is very small but

0:55:23.599,0:55:27.680
still it can happen and you should be

0:55:25.839,0:55:28.960
comfortable with this thought and if

0:55:27.680,0:55:30.799
you're not then you need to choose

0:55:28.960,0:55:32.480
another license

0:55:30.799,0:55:34.559
something maybe that is viral like the

0:55:32.480,0:55:36.079
gpl or so where they at least are forced

0:55:34.559,0:55:37.040
to publish the sources that they built

0:55:36.079,0:55:40.079
on your

0:55:37.040,0:55:42.799
on your work on top of your work

0:55:40.079,0:55:43.920
because and this is where your former

0:55:42.799,0:55:47.359
question comes in

0:55:43.920,0:55:49.040
um relicensing of your code can become

0:55:47.359,0:55:50.720
quite tricky as long as you are the only

0:55:49.040,0:55:53.680
person who wrote it then

0:55:50.720,0:55:55.839
there is no problem right okay but as

0:55:53.680,0:55:57.359
soon as you want to introduce a license

0:55:55.839,0:55:58.400
for example if you want to switch from

0:55:57.359,0:56:00.799
mit

0:55:58.400,0:56:02.000
to a somewhat more restrictive gpl

0:56:00.799,0:56:05.839
because the gpl has this

0:56:02.000,0:56:07.920
viral ver virality clause in it

0:56:05.839,0:56:09.760
you actually need to ask everyone who

0:56:07.920,0:56:10.319
even contributed a single line to your

0:56:09.760,0:56:13.200
code

0:56:10.319,0:56:15.040
or even a just a single character if

0:56:13.200,0:56:17.359
they are okay with that and if they say

0:56:15.040,0:56:18.799
no then you have to replace whatever

0:56:17.359,0:56:22.480
they contributed

0:56:18.799,0:56:24.720
right okay interesting yeah so

0:56:22.480,0:56:26.480
this is the reason why octoprint to this

0:56:24.720,0:56:30.079
day is still a gpl

0:56:26.480,0:56:30.720
licensed because i started off of cura

0:56:30.079,0:56:33.200
as i mentioned

0:56:30.720,0:56:36.720
cura was licensed agpl so i inherited

0:56:33.200,0:56:38.880
the license because it's viral

0:56:36.720,0:56:40.880
and these days i actually would prefer

0:56:38.880,0:56:42.720
to be able to just switch it over to

0:56:40.880,0:56:44.640
something slightly different more like

0:56:42.720,0:56:46.319
the lgpl maybe because it would make

0:56:44.640,0:56:48.079
more sense in the case of something that

0:56:46.319,0:56:49.920
is more like a platform or framework at

0:56:48.079,0:56:51.440
this point than

0:56:49.920,0:56:54.400
like a network appliance or something

0:56:51.440,0:56:56.960
like that for which the agplus moment

0:56:54.400,0:56:58.880
but in order to do that i had to i would

0:56:56.960,0:57:01.599
i would need to get the legal

0:56:58.880,0:57:03.280
permission from every single person who

0:57:01.599,0:57:05.200
ever contributed to both

0:57:03.280,0:57:06.960
the parts of cura that are still in my

0:57:05.200,0:57:09.119
com layer as well

0:57:06.960,0:57:10.400
as everyone who ever even put a single

0:57:09.119,0:57:12.559
digit somewhere in

0:57:10.400,0:57:14.799
in octoprince code and this is like how

0:57:12.559,0:57:16.880
many people like hundreds or thousands

0:57:14.799,0:57:19.280
yeah yeah i actually do not know right

0:57:16.880,0:57:21.280
now how big the network graph is but

0:57:19.280,0:57:22.640
it's quite a number of people and

0:57:21.280,0:57:25.839
frankly

0:57:22.640,0:57:27.040
i do not i do not think that many would

0:57:25.839,0:57:29.520
answer

0:57:27.040,0:57:31.599
true so i mean even if they would

0:57:29.520,0:57:34.240
technically be okay with it

0:57:31.599,0:57:35.839
yeah right p try getting people's email

0:57:34.240,0:57:36.640
addresses first then trying to get in

0:57:35.839,0:57:38.079
touch with them

0:57:36.640,0:57:40.000
then trying to get a permission from

0:57:38.079,0:57:41.200
them so yeah best

0:57:40.000,0:57:43.119
settle on a license that you are

0:57:41.200,0:57:45.040
completely 100 comfortable

0:57:43.119,0:57:46.799
when you release something because

0:57:45.040,0:57:48.559
changing it depending on

0:57:46.799,0:57:49.839
how many people have already contributed

0:57:48.559,0:57:53.119
can be a big

0:57:49.839,0:57:54.559
big pain in the behind

0:57:53.119,0:57:55.680
that is true okay i wasn't aware of that

0:57:54.559,0:57:57.040
see i learned something new as well

0:57:55.680,0:57:58.400
which is great which is why i like

0:57:57.040,0:57:59.359
collaborating with so many people and

0:57:58.400,0:58:00.319
just chatting to people because you

0:57:59.359,0:58:02.640
always learn

0:58:00.319,0:58:03.680
you know different things i know we've

0:58:02.640,0:58:05.920
covered this already

0:58:03.680,0:58:08.079
um just to say that i don't think there

0:58:05.920,0:58:10.720
is a best license choose one

0:58:08.079,0:58:12.160
that you're comfortable with probably um

0:58:10.720,0:58:13.119
i prefer i mean there are a couple of

0:58:12.160,0:58:16.319
popular ones

0:58:13.119,0:58:18.400
sorry which ones yeah

0:58:16.319,0:58:20.000
there are i mean the most common ones

0:58:18.400,0:58:22.720
these days are the gpl

0:58:20.000,0:58:24.960
the mit and the bsd i would say maybe a

0:58:22.720,0:58:26.960
bit of the apache 2 stuff but that's

0:58:24.960,0:58:28.880
that depends a bit on the in on the on

0:58:26.960,0:58:31.119
the ecosystem you find yourself in i

0:58:28.880,0:58:33.440
know apache 2 is quite um

0:58:31.119,0:58:35.359
uh quite popular in the java group but

0:58:33.440,0:58:36.000
i've seen it less and less in the in the

0:58:35.359,0:58:39.440
python

0:58:36.000,0:58:42.000
and node.js ecosystem

0:58:39.440,0:58:44.160
so yeah and i would just suggest to sit

0:58:42.000,0:58:46.480
down and read through the most

0:58:44.160,0:58:47.599
common ones i mean on the one side you

0:58:46.480,0:58:50.799
have the viral

0:58:47.599,0:58:53.040
stuff like the gpl the agpl the lgbl

0:58:50.799,0:58:54.079
gpl and on the other side you have the

0:58:53.040,0:58:56.960
non-viral stuff

0:58:54.079,0:58:58.720
like the mit the bsd the apache 2 and a

0:58:56.960,0:59:01.920
bunch of other things

0:58:58.720,0:59:03.520
and just yeah go on tldrlegal.com

0:59:01.920,0:59:05.359
click through them and just figure out

0:59:03.520,0:59:08.640
what the differences are and

0:59:05.359,0:59:12.079
what you want for yourself personally

0:59:08.640,0:59:14.000
i so small stuff that i primarily

0:59:12.079,0:59:16.240
write to quickly fix some kind of

0:59:14.000,0:59:18.160
problem that i have and that i

0:59:16.240,0:59:20.319
then just throw online don't give a lot

0:59:18.160,0:59:22.079
of maintenance for or something more

0:59:20.319,0:59:24.160
like i merge prs when they come in and

0:59:22.079,0:59:26.240
if there is a big bug and i have an idea

0:59:24.160,0:59:27.599
idea of how to fix it i fix it but

0:59:26.240,0:59:29.599
otherwise it's not that big of a

0:59:27.599,0:59:32.480
priority and more like a pet project

0:59:29.599,0:59:32.960
i usually these days license under mit

0:59:32.480,0:59:35.760
okay

0:59:32.960,0:59:37.760
because it's like a here you have it i

0:59:35.760,0:59:39.760
don't really care about it

0:59:37.760,0:59:40.799
have fun with it use it if it is useful

0:59:39.760,0:59:42.880
for you yay and

0:59:40.799,0:59:44.480
if not then well but what are you doing

0:59:42.880,0:59:46.160
here um

0:59:44.480,0:59:48.000
but for for things that i really care

0:59:46.160,0:59:50.240
about like octoprint

0:59:48.000,0:59:51.680
i would never even if i had the choice i

0:59:50.240,0:59:53.440
would never license octoprint under

0:59:51.680,0:59:56.160
something like an mit or bst

0:59:53.440,0:59:57.599
bsd license because this this viral

0:59:56.160,1:00:00.240
character in this case there is

0:59:57.599,1:00:00.960
just too much work on this that i do not

1:00:00.240,1:00:03.599
really want

1:00:00.960,1:00:04.000
to have to face the situation that i've

1:00:03.599,1:00:05.680
now

1:00:04.000,1:00:07.040
actually faced a bunch of times with

1:00:05.680,1:00:10.559
companies who simply ignored

1:00:07.040,1:00:12.079
the license that they put it in some

1:00:10.559,1:00:12.559
kind of product of theirs claim it's

1:00:12.079,1:00:16.480
theirs

1:00:12.559,1:00:18.000
and make a ton of money from it so um

1:00:16.480,1:00:20.240
especially considering the fact that i'm

1:00:18.000,1:00:20.799
trying to live from the work that i put

1:00:20.240,1:00:23.839
in this

1:00:20.799,1:00:27.359
right it's like also i think

1:00:23.839,1:00:28.319
it's i mean i know this is kind of a

1:00:27.359,1:00:30.720
philosophy

1:00:28.319,1:00:31.359
philosophical war a bit going on there

1:00:30.720,1:00:33.359
between the

1:00:31.359,1:00:34.960
between the viral and the non-viral camp

1:00:33.359,1:00:36.799
when it comes to open source licenses

1:00:34.960,1:00:39.839
but personally i think

1:00:36.799,1:00:42.880
if we want to somehow get

1:00:39.839,1:00:46.240
companies to actually respect and

1:00:42.880,1:00:48.000
and realize that open sources work and

1:00:46.240,1:00:49.359
that it doesn't fall from the sky and

1:00:48.000,1:00:52.720
that maybe they

1:00:49.359,1:00:54.319
need to um they they need to contribute

1:00:52.720,1:00:56.000
back to it something like dual licensing

1:00:54.319,1:00:59.119
or something would also be an option

1:00:56.000,1:01:02.960
like if you are using

1:00:59.119,1:01:04.000
my my my stuff in an educational or in a

1:01:02.960,1:01:06.799
private setting then

1:01:04.000,1:01:07.359
it's licensed under n and under my under

1:01:06.799,1:01:09.680
under

1:01:07.359,1:01:11.040
under mit and otherwise it's gpl or

1:01:09.680,1:01:13.119
something like that or you can

1:01:11.040,1:01:14.960
the other way around sorry so you can't

1:01:13.119,1:01:16.559
do stuff like you can buy a different

1:01:14.960,1:01:17.200
license of course for that you need to

1:01:16.559,1:01:20.720
have

1:01:17.200,1:01:22.240
everything under your control but yeah

1:01:20.720,1:01:23.920
that is a really interesting one

1:01:22.240,1:01:25.359
actually i do i do like that having two

1:01:23.920,1:01:26.400
licenses you know if you're using it for

1:01:25.359,1:01:29.440
a pet project

1:01:26.400,1:01:30.559
or for some educational school then fine

1:01:29.440,1:01:31.760
you know use it

1:01:30.559,1:01:33.359
whereas if you're going to make money

1:01:31.760,1:01:33.680
out of this then you've got to either

1:01:33.359,1:01:34.880
yeah

1:01:33.680,1:01:36.480
you've got some clause you've got to

1:01:34.880,1:01:38.240
have you've got to keep your code open

1:01:36.480,1:01:39.680
source as well or whatever it is exactly

1:01:38.240,1:01:40.720
so i do like that actually that's really

1:01:39.680,1:01:41.920
interesting that's something i think i

1:01:40.720,1:01:44.319
want to start doing

1:01:41.920,1:01:47.040
i'm having dual license i'll have to

1:01:44.319,1:01:48.880
look more into that

1:01:47.040,1:01:51.760
i've got some people in the chat i did

1:01:48.880,1:01:54.319
paste in some examples

1:01:51.760,1:01:55.359
about mit and where like ansible bash

1:01:54.319,1:01:58.960
and [ __ ]

1:01:55.359,1:02:02.000
you sorry uh where is it babel.net core

1:01:58.960,1:02:05.520
rails use mit whereas ansible bash

1:02:02.000,1:02:08.240
and [ __ ] use uh gpl uh version

1:02:05.520,1:02:09.920
3 and then santosh is saying that

1:02:08.240,1:02:11.760
angular is mit

1:02:09.920,1:02:12.960
so it's always yeah always always quite

1:02:11.760,1:02:16.880
interesting

1:02:12.960,1:02:16.880
to see what other projects are using

1:02:17.920,1:02:21.680
yeah when including other projects in

1:02:19.760,1:02:23.280
your projects you need to look at those

1:02:21.680,1:02:24.720
as junior was saying because they might

1:02:23.280,1:02:26.400
have some restrictions what you can do

1:02:24.720,1:02:28.079
with it can you sell it

1:02:26.400,1:02:29.839
and and so forth because you might be

1:02:28.079,1:02:30.960
able to sell it you need to have open

1:02:29.839,1:02:32.559
source

1:02:30.960,1:02:34.079
now you also need to be very very

1:02:32.559,1:02:35.680
careful when for example

1:02:34.079,1:02:37.760
not every not all licenses are

1:02:35.680,1:02:38.799
compatible to each other for example you

1:02:37.760,1:02:43.119
cannot

1:02:38.799,1:02:44.319
um i'm trying to think of a good example

1:02:43.119,1:02:46.400
right now but i can't

1:02:44.319,1:02:48.559
for the life of me um in theory there

1:02:46.400,1:02:51.119
are certain licenses situations

1:02:48.559,1:02:52.799
where if i having an having my stuff

1:02:51.119,1:02:55.359
licensed under an agpl

1:02:52.799,1:02:56.720
would try to utilize this library under

1:02:55.359,1:02:57.520
something else which i can think of

1:02:56.720,1:02:59.760
right now

1:02:57.520,1:03:01.440
then this would not work because the

1:02:59.760,1:03:03.280
licenses would

1:03:01.440,1:03:04.720
yeah negate each other not negate but

1:03:03.280,1:03:05.760
you know like they would have clauses

1:03:04.720,1:03:07.760
that conflict without

1:03:05.760,1:03:09.039
with with each other so it is very

1:03:07.760,1:03:10.480
important that whenever you

1:03:09.039,1:03:12.559
work on something that is open source

1:03:10.480,1:03:14.000
you actually check if you can include it

1:03:12.559,1:03:16.960
for example if you work on something

1:03:14.000,1:03:18.720
that is mit i think you cannot

1:03:16.960,1:03:20.079
incorporate stuff that is licensed under

1:03:18.720,1:03:22.240
the gpl

1:03:20.079,1:03:25.599
without re-licensing your own project as

1:03:22.240,1:03:29.599
gpl because the viral clause in the gpl

1:03:25.599,1:03:31.920
restricts things further so that the mit

1:03:29.599,1:03:33.039
right you you you you would give your

1:03:31.920,1:03:36.240
stuff away for free

1:03:33.039,1:03:38.480
but um so completely for under under

1:03:36.240,1:03:41.039
terms of the mit but if you bind against

1:03:38.480,1:03:42.960
stuff that is gpl or pull whole code

1:03:41.039,1:03:45.200
snippets in that are gpl

1:03:42.960,1:03:47.039
you are doing the same to that as well

1:03:45.200,1:03:48.480
and this is against this license because

1:03:47.039,1:03:51.200
this license says

1:03:48.480,1:03:51.760
you may only share it if you share it

1:03:51.200,1:03:54.079
alike

1:03:51.760,1:03:55.280
so with a gpl or a gpl compatible

1:03:54.079,1:03:56.880
license

1:03:55.280,1:03:58.640
which i think actually hasn't has an

1:03:56.880,1:04:01.200
exception for mit but still

1:03:58.640,1:04:01.760
i mean yeah there was a famous story i

1:04:01.200,1:04:03.440
can't remember

1:04:01.760,1:04:05.359
the the project or the company name but

1:04:03.440,1:04:06.799
they had built this open source project

1:04:05.359,1:04:08.319
that had done really well for like i

1:04:06.799,1:04:09.760
think like seven years

1:04:08.319,1:04:11.119
and then they thought you know what we

1:04:09.760,1:04:12.000
want to we want to make it a closed

1:04:11.119,1:04:15.280
source project because

1:04:12.000,1:04:15.760
now it's like it's it's it's done so

1:04:15.280,1:04:17.200
well

1:04:15.760,1:04:18.799
but obviously by the licensing they

1:04:17.200,1:04:20.559
couldn't just do that so they kept this

1:04:18.799,1:04:21.680
open source version that the community

1:04:20.559,1:04:23.359
can maintain

1:04:21.680,1:04:25.119
and then the company took the code and

1:04:23.359,1:04:26.480
started the closed source version

1:04:25.119,1:04:28.240
and legally it was correct they found a

1:04:26.480,1:04:29.839
loophole but oh my god everyone hated

1:04:28.240,1:04:30.880
that company forever afterwards after

1:04:29.839,1:04:31.680
doing that because literally they just

1:04:30.880,1:04:34.240
did it

1:04:31.680,1:04:35.920
actually happens actually quite a lot we

1:04:34.240,1:04:38.400
also had a case like this in in in the

1:04:35.920,1:04:40.400
3d printing space a couple of years ago

1:04:38.400,1:04:41.599
when uh when a popular when a popular

1:04:40.400,1:04:43.440
piece of

1:04:41.599,1:04:45.200
was it the firmware no it was a host

1:04:43.440,1:04:47.680
software popular piece

1:04:45.200,1:04:49.520
of basically like a compatible competit

1:04:47.680,1:04:50.319
competitor of octoprint but a desktop

1:04:49.520,1:04:52.960
application

1:04:50.319,1:04:54.480
uh went closed source people were like

1:04:52.960,1:04:56.400
oh

1:04:54.480,1:04:57.520
and it was a bit tricky in this case

1:04:56.400,1:04:59.920
because

1:04:57.520,1:05:01.039
they kept the they kept the the oldest

1:04:59.920,1:05:03.440
old version kept

1:05:01.039,1:05:05.280
kept it open source but all the code was

1:05:03.440,1:05:05.920
owned by this one person so that the

1:05:05.280,1:05:08.480
license

1:05:05.920,1:05:09.119
in this case the license which was

1:05:08.480,1:05:13.280
completely

1:05:09.119,1:05:16.160
legally or fine because i mean if

1:05:13.280,1:05:17.119
if all the people that did that that

1:05:16.160,1:05:19.440
wrote the code

1:05:17.119,1:05:21.119
uh say it's okay to do then it's okay to

1:05:19.440,1:05:22.640
do and in this case that the code was

1:05:21.119,1:05:23.359
basically built on the shoulders of one

1:05:22.640,1:05:26.640
single guy

1:05:23.359,1:05:29.119
so that was fine

1:05:26.640,1:05:30.000
and this person had to eat so they made

1:05:29.119,1:05:33.280
this decision

1:05:30.000,1:05:35.200
so sometimes it's okay and

1:05:33.280,1:05:37.200
i mean it feels weird and you look at

1:05:35.200,1:05:38.720
that in situations like this and are

1:05:37.200,1:05:41.200
like

1:05:38.720,1:05:42.079
but i mean there's always two sides to a

1:05:41.200,1:05:43.599
story

1:05:42.079,1:05:45.280
of course i think that's where it goes

1:05:43.599,1:05:46.559
back if we go we've almost gone full

1:05:45.280,1:05:48.160
circle i'm looking at the clock and

1:05:46.559,1:05:51.920
we're gonna have to call it a day soon

1:05:48.160,1:05:55.280
but uh full circle to um

1:05:51.920,1:05:57.520
that i think i wasn't saying now but

1:05:55.280,1:05:59.839
yeah full circle two if companies could

1:05:57.520,1:06:02.240
spawn uh could donate or sponsor

1:05:59.839,1:06:04.079
um these projects then it becomes less

1:06:02.240,1:06:05.920
of an issue and a lot of these companies

1:06:04.079,1:06:07.520
you know spend thousands per day on

1:06:05.920,1:06:09.200
contractors working on their project

1:06:07.520,1:06:10.000
they don't think about the free software

1:06:09.200,1:06:11.280
they're getting

1:06:10.000,1:06:13.359
where if they just gave kind of a

1:06:11.280,1:06:15.039
hundred dollars a month it would just

1:06:13.359,1:06:16.400
be and so many of these companies did

1:06:15.039,1:06:17.760
that even probably ten dollars a month

1:06:16.400,1:06:18.720
which would be a drop in the ocean for

1:06:17.760,1:06:21.119
them

1:06:18.720,1:06:22.960
then it would just really help open

1:06:21.119,1:06:24.400
source move so much faster so many more

1:06:22.960,1:06:27.520
people could go

1:06:24.400,1:06:28.720
full time on open source and then then

1:06:27.520,1:06:30.720
the tools that they're using could then

1:06:28.720,1:06:32.720
move so much faster

1:06:30.720,1:06:33.920
i think you know there are so many ways

1:06:32.720,1:06:35.760
to make money from open source and

1:06:33.920,1:06:37.599
sponsorship is just one way but it does

1:06:35.760,1:06:40.160
look like it is

1:06:37.599,1:06:41.520
that is growing because selling support

1:06:40.160,1:06:43.520
like you said

1:06:41.520,1:06:45.760
it was always been popular in the past

1:06:43.520,1:06:47.680
but it's not great

1:06:45.760,1:06:49.280
it's it doesn't scare me scale yeah

1:06:47.680,1:06:52.400
exactly

1:06:49.280,1:06:54.079
exactly so yeah it's definitely

1:06:52.400,1:06:55.520
something to think about and i think

1:06:54.079,1:06:57.680
it's going to be

1:06:55.520,1:06:58.799
it's going to be interesting uh in the

1:06:57.680,1:07:00.400
near future i think

1:06:58.799,1:07:02.240
people have become look at github doing

1:07:00.400,1:07:04.400
github sponsors right so

1:07:02.240,1:07:05.280
now anyone okay some countries aren't

1:07:04.400,1:07:06.640
covered yet but

1:07:05.280,1:07:08.079
the number is increasing last time i

1:07:06.640,1:07:10.000
looked i think it was like mid 30s the

1:07:08.079,1:07:11.520
amount of countries that were supported

1:07:10.000,1:07:13.359
but anyone can create an account on

1:07:11.520,1:07:15.039
github sponsors and people can

1:07:13.359,1:07:16.799
give them money i know we have people in

1:07:15.039,1:07:18.400
my community that have really helped out

1:07:16.799,1:07:20.480
and i say please create a sponsorship

1:07:18.400,1:07:21.520
account it's free just to apply for it

1:07:20.480,1:07:22.799
and he said but why would i do that

1:07:21.520,1:07:24.319
who'd want to give me money i said i'm

1:07:22.799,1:07:24.960
i'm hinting to you i want to give you

1:07:24.319,1:07:26.240
money

1:07:24.960,1:07:28.640
you've been really helpful thank you so

1:07:26.240,1:07:30.160
much so um

1:07:28.640,1:07:31.760
yeah i think more and more people should

1:07:30.160,1:07:34.000
apply for that and go and

1:07:31.760,1:07:35.359
add value like you said to projects just

1:07:34.000,1:07:37.839
go add value and add value

1:07:35.359,1:07:38.799
isn't always just pull requests and and

1:07:37.839,1:07:41.520
so forth so

1:07:38.799,1:07:42.640
uh yeah that's really interesting i

1:07:41.520,1:07:44.240
think it's just been such a great

1:07:42.640,1:07:45.440
discussion especially the licenses that

1:07:44.240,1:07:47.760
was a

1:07:45.440,1:07:48.559
a really a good pleasant surprise but i

1:07:47.760,1:07:50.559
think there's a lot of people

1:07:48.559,1:07:51.680
a lot of things that sorry it's a

1:07:50.559,1:07:54.319
subject that people

1:07:51.680,1:07:55.359
shy away from a lot i know i do because

1:07:54.319,1:07:57.280
it's just

1:07:55.359,1:07:58.880
crazy but it's good that you've done

1:07:57.280,1:07:59.760
your research you know about he's gonna

1:07:58.880,1:08:02.400
talk on it and

1:07:59.760,1:08:05.359
and so on i would link you the talk but

1:08:02.400,1:08:05.359
it's in german sadly

1:08:05.680,1:08:09.280
yeah my jam is not so good you have to

1:08:07.039,1:08:11.200
do an english version

1:08:09.280,1:08:12.799
i mean i could do the slice in in

1:08:11.200,1:08:15.680
english maybe at some point but

1:08:12.799,1:08:17.359
yeah so that was that was quite a good a

1:08:15.680,1:08:18.960
nicely filled talk as well i got to say

1:08:17.359,1:08:21.440
i was pleasantly surprised by that back

1:08:18.960,1:08:23.120
then because i figured if i go

1:08:21.440,1:08:24.719
it was it was at the maker faire in

1:08:23.120,1:08:26.880
germany so like

1:08:24.719,1:08:28.640
lots of people who just build stuff and

1:08:26.880,1:08:30.159
are usually not even remotely thinking

1:08:28.640,1:08:31.279
about licensing so not software people

1:08:30.159,1:08:33.920
primarily but more like

1:08:31.279,1:08:34.719
tinkerers and hardware tinkerers and and

1:08:33.920,1:08:36.560
people who knit

1:08:34.719,1:08:38.000
maybe and stuff like that and i just

1:08:36.560,1:08:40.799
figured maybe it would be good

1:08:38.000,1:08:42.480
to try to shed some light on this topic

1:08:40.799,1:08:44.480
because as an open source dev

1:08:42.480,1:08:47.920
like it's it's something that i actually

1:08:44.480,1:08:50.239
had to think about and learn about

1:08:47.920,1:08:52.000
and at first i was a bit worried when i

1:08:50.239,1:08:54.960
handed in this this talk

1:08:52.000,1:08:56.480
that the somewhat dry topic would maybe

1:08:54.960,1:08:58.719
scare people off but

1:08:56.480,1:09:00.319
uh apparently they were actually

1:08:58.719,1:09:02.400
interested and happy that someone would

1:09:00.319,1:09:04.880
would explain it to them so yeah that

1:09:02.400,1:09:06.239
was a nice experience as well

1:09:04.880,1:09:07.520
maybe at some point i have to give it

1:09:06.239,1:09:07.920
again in english or something i don't

1:09:07.520,1:09:09.279
know

1:09:07.920,1:09:11.120
i i think so i think it'd be very

1:09:09.279,1:09:11.920
popular it is something that people

1:09:11.120,1:09:13.199
don't

1:09:11.920,1:09:14.239
would like to know more about but don't

1:09:13.199,1:09:15.440
want to talk about because they just

1:09:14.239,1:09:18.640
don't know

1:09:15.440,1:09:20.239
um so i think it'll be really good okay

1:09:18.640,1:09:21.600
i think last final question

1:09:20.239,1:09:23.279
i think this is quite an interesting one

1:09:21.600,1:09:24.000
so apollo thank you so much for the

1:09:23.279,1:09:26.640
question

1:09:24.000,1:09:27.279
and i don't i'm not sure about if about

1:09:26.640,1:09:29.199
this

1:09:27.279,1:09:30.799
sorry just to hear what gina thinks i've

1:09:29.199,1:09:34.560
had any experience or any stories to

1:09:30.799,1:09:37.759
share on this

1:09:34.560,1:09:40.719
uh so the question is um

1:09:37.759,1:09:42.159
how would someone under 18 uh make money

1:09:40.719,1:09:43.920
from open source does it

1:09:42.159,1:09:45.440
does it change because they're under 18

1:09:43.920,1:09:47.279
i don't know

1:09:45.440,1:09:48.960
i'm not entirely sure about for example

1:09:47.279,1:09:50.080
github's terms of service but i'm pretty

1:09:48.960,1:09:52.560
sure i have to be

1:09:50.080,1:09:53.359
of legal age in order to open account

1:09:52.560,1:09:57.040
open account

1:09:53.359,1:09:59.520
open an account dear and me my tongue is

1:09:57.040,1:10:00.840
tricky today probably yeah that's

1:09:59.520,1:10:03.840
probably it

1:10:00.840,1:10:07.280
um for patreon i think you have to be

1:10:03.840,1:10:08.640
uh legal and yeah i could imagine that

1:10:07.280,1:10:11.120
this will be tricky because

1:10:08.640,1:10:12.640
i i probably i would imagine that a lot

1:10:11.120,1:10:14.640
of companies

1:10:12.640,1:10:16.960
like github or patreon would probably

1:10:14.640,1:10:17.520
like to have you as a creator on board

1:10:16.960,1:10:19.920
but

1:10:17.520,1:10:20.640
but it would be like a legal minefield

1:10:19.920,1:10:22.880
for it

1:10:20.640,1:10:24.320
for for them to do it so that makes it

1:10:22.880,1:10:26.960
probably a bit tricky

1:10:24.320,1:10:27.760
maybe if you had support by a guardian

1:10:26.960,1:10:30.480
or

1:10:27.760,1:10:32.080
like a parent or someone that's that's

1:10:30.480,1:10:34.560
about the only advice that i can give

1:10:32.080,1:10:37.520
here because i don't know it's

1:10:34.560,1:10:38.159
yeah it is a legal minefield i mean i

1:10:37.520,1:10:40.239
see it with

1:10:38.159,1:10:42.159
with with stuff like a support forum

1:10:40.239,1:10:43.679
only just where you are i

1:10:42.159,1:10:45.360
suddenly have to think about stuff like

1:10:43.679,1:10:48.800
copper and uh

1:10:45.360,1:10:50.239
and and the child protection laws in in

1:10:48.800,1:10:50.960
germany and all that and everything

1:10:50.239,1:10:52.880
becomes

1:10:50.960,1:10:54.480
extremely complicated just because you
